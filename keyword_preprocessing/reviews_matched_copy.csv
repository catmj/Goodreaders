343,a river enchanted,rebecca ross,4,117995659,0063055988,"80,416",4.07,480pp,"The book was a great find, and I really enjoyed reading it. The summary doesn't do justice to the book's actual plot. This story wasn't just about JacThe book was a great find, and I really enjoyed reading it. The summary doesn't do justice to the book's actual plot. This story wasn't just about Jack; it was about the many people in the town whose lives and relationships were intertwined. One thing I really loved about this story was the relationship between Torin and Sidra. Sometimes, you can tell which character's story an author is really passionate about telling. Their relationship on the paper felt real and tangible, and they had very realistic emotions and fleshed-out dialogues.However, since Jack is the main character in this novel, I was terribly disappointed in the way he was regarded as a side character. His romance with Adaira felt very frustrating because I genuinely couldn't feel the chemistry between the characters. I felt like the author just shoved the enemies-to-lovers trope in our faces. It didn't feel real or fleshed out properly, and I kept comparing their relationship to that of Torin and Sidra (which left me wanting more). In fact, at the end, I was a bit relieved when Adaira decided to leave Jack to remain in the west (or east?) I forgot which side they were on.In the end, I will definitely get a paper copy of this book to keep at home. It was a very warm, cozy and slow (EMPHASIS on SLOW) read....more","Mar 08, 2025","Mar 12, 2025","Mar 08, 2025",Hardcover,"Feb 15, 2022"

I off and on found her annoying because she was so pretty and peppy so I was so surprised to be able to relate to her. The abuse she went through, the dysfunctional narcissistic family, the relationship with her sister, and the pregnancy loss I understood and felt for her. (Minus the fame and money) I did feel bad about her being so obviously exploited and what the media said was horrible. But how she was able to get through it and get out of the conservatorship, which FYI is only $1,000 for her family to muzzle her with. The book was just eye opening and sad how many who are in the spotlight don't seem to have any real foundation, especially child stars. I wish her much happiness and GOOD adventures to come in her life. I hope her freedom finally allows her to heal.FYI I listened to the version on Audible, which really helped because I have ADHD.

LiDon’t get me wrong, I had a lot of fun reading this book but there were also many spots where some heavy editing would have helped speed things up. Like a lot of spots. I think this did take away from the overall “punch” of the final book. I was impatient for a lot of sections and it seemed like we were focusing on the same events, the same emotions, the same thoughts, etc. I also found that some of the plot twists (or basically ways to keep characters alive) felt like a bit of a cop out. The emotionally attached part of me was happy that certain characters didn’t die but it didn’t always feel realistic (for a book about demons and fae I know).

I'd been waiting until I felt ready to read what, from the reviews, was sure to be a heart-wrenching and depressing story of an impoverished and alcoholic mother and her young son.Perhaps my expectations were set too high, but I never really connected with anyone in this book.

I came to this story unfamiliar the author and did not expect to be so entirely blown away by the elegant prose. Only a poet could write with such grace!A tumultuous, and at times heart-wrenching, story of poor Vietnamese immigrants to the US offers the perfect juxtaposition to the graceful writing.

The author must certainly have spent time practicing and becoming the**A few minor spoilers ahead**The Overstory reads like poetry spoken by nature. The author must certainly have spent time practicing and becoming the voice of the natural world.What struck me most was how the natural world (and, specifically, trees) approach time. The first 150 pages or so of the book introduce us to nine main characters, my favorite definitely being Patricia Westerford. In many of their stories, we journey through family histories that go back over 100 years. Using tree-like transitions to describe the passage of time, we're able to jump decades into the future, what should feel like a significant leap, in the calming, nurturing words of nature, through seasons and tree lifecycles.After being introduced to the main characters, their journeys begin slowly connecting. In short, many of them become eco-activists, hoping to save the three percent of old growth forest left in the country, most of which lies in the Pacific Northwest, from deforestation.While I enjoyed all of the characters, I learned the most from Patricia. A pioneering forestry scientist, she makes remarkable discoveries as a young researcher and decides to publish her findings that trees communicate with each other in many different ways. Post publication, the natural science community completely dismisses her, some even suggesting she's become unhinged. She retreats into a largely lonely life. Over the years that follow, her discoveries are vindicated by additional data, which leads to the publication of her book.(Insert book name that I can't remember)becomes *the* definitive book on trees. She then settles into her role as a researcher and occasional public speaker, bringing much greater public awareness to forests and trees. I learned so much from her character's reverence of the natural world.I have a strong feeling this will be one of those books I become nostalgic for when I see it on the bookshelf in years to come.

The story alternates between this and Fiona, who is Yale's friend's sister, some thirty years later as she searches Paris for her estranged daughter.I absolutely loved the parts of this story set in 1980s Chicago. The author successfully depicts the devastating loss, hopelessness, and discrimination facing the gay community as the AIDS epidemic unfolds. I commend her for bringing this story to a new generation of readers (myself included) who did not experience the AIDS crisis firsthand.My struggle with this book came with the present-day search for Fiona's long lost adult daughter. This part of the story just didn't grab my attention. I so loved being in Yale's world, and, though the two storylines eventually connect, I couldn't help but wish the entire novel had been set in 1980s Chicago.

I was so intrigued by the dual timelines. It was an absolute blast to get taken on a journey back and forth from seven years prior to current day. Ashley Poston did this so well! I've recently read a couple of other books that try to have two different timelines going at the same time and neither worked, but it Ashley accomplished it perfectly in The Seven Year Slip.I love that the magic of the apartment is never explained. It was done in a way that didn't leave you curious, just pleasantly surprised each time travel.I've heard people criticize some of the characters' decisions and had to laugh. Like, do you want perfect people or real people? I prefer characters to be realistic and the fact that they sometimes make choices you disagree with with an outside perspective is what makes the book amazing! The characters are so well developed and every action in the book fits with the background we learn about them. I love that they grow throughout the story and that their relationship grows with them. Honestly, so good!I haven't even mentioned the other characters in the book, wow. I felt connected to every single one.Little spoiler below:That he nicknames her Lemon is just the cutest and filled me with butterflies each time!...more",not setnot set,not setnot set,"Jan 07, 2024",Paperback,"Jun 27, 2023"

Sometimes I feel like I am being held captive when my mother makes me stay home one night. I cannot imagine being isolated from the world for so long. Having no memories, experiences or stories to tell would be agonizing. Olly entering her life gave her excitement and hope. If I were in her shoes i would have done the same thing, and I hope I would have a nurse willing to help me out.

I loved the way all of the characters were portrayed and the desperation that Madeline's mother has for her is very obvious, almost as obvious as Madeline's hunger for freedom. The want for freedom is easy to relate to as a teen. The extreme isolation she faces makes me appreciate the amount of freedom I actually have.

This book is a retelling of the little mermaid and follows the perspectives of a siren and a prince as their problems entwine.What I likedI liked how Lira was ruthless, yet caring and i enjoyed reading about her past and the hatred towards her mother.I loved Lira's planning to get back to her throne and overthrow the queen.Lira attitude was well written and she felt very real, there was never a time of sudden mood changes in this book and I loved her witty comebacks.What I didn't likeElian's character reminded me too much of the Riden from Daughter of the Pirate King. Elian was a weird character and I just couldn't place what he wanted and how he was feeling even though we did get his perspective. He just wasn't interesting enough.Even though he is inspired by the little mermaid, there is very little connection between the two. Lira isn't a pretty mermaid, Elian is 'the' prince. The story isn't right either so I don't understand why people are comparing the two.The story itself wasn't exciting and kind of dull, it mostly focused on finding the gem and Lira and Elian using each other.The relationship was also not right. At one point they don't like each other and the next Lira is asking him to kiss her. I just didn't build up.There also wasn't a heap of actionThe endingThe ending was pretty cool, Lira got the courage to overthrow her mother, Elian realised his deep love for Lira. A whole heap of fighting and then a happy ending. Not much....more",not set,not set,"Sep 17, 2018",Hardcover,"Mar 06, 2018"

I absolutely adore this book. It is**spoiler alert** I have read 70 books and only twice have I given all the books in the series such a high rating. I absolutely adore this book. It is told from Tella's perspective and honestly, I enjoyed reading from her p.o.v more than Scarlett's. This is only because I found Tella more independent and I am such a sucker for strong female leads.Even though I enjoyed the world in 'Caraval' better, it wasn't that bad here because I would have liked to see more of the magic and the wonders. I believe the last book was more magical because we were just being introduced to 'Caraval' and Stephanie Garber had to put in a little more effort to impress the readers but in this book, we were already quite familiar with it.The book wasn't that heavy on romance but it was definitely one of the key points in the book. Jacks was just perfect and Dante was not my favourite, even though they sort of had the same personality in a way. Jacks was a new character in the book and even before I knew him as the prince of hearts, I fell in love with him in the carriage. He was beautifully arrogant. Dante, I can't even talk about him. I hated him from the very start to the very end. I felt as though Tella could do much better and he wasn't even charming as others are making him, he was just annoying. I was team Jella from the start and am still shipping Jacks and Tella together.The ending was perfect, it was magnificent and even better than the last book. It was so clean and smooth, I think it may be the best ending I have ever read. Legend was revealed and Tella admitted to having fallen in love with him (I hope this changes in the next book). It was a flawless reveal, not exciting as it was kinda obvious, but still perfect.Scarlett and Julian were on a rocky boat in their relationship and Scarlett even started looking for her last fiancé. I just really hope she doesn't end up with Julian, their relationship was only sweet in 'Caraval'. I am dying to know if Julian is actually real with her or not or if she will end up finding a person better. Julian kept on lying and was just really untrustworthy, especially because he ended up being 'someones' brother.Overall, I loved the characters in this book and I adore Tella, even more than Scarlett. The world was mesmerising. I am excited to read the last book in the trilogy....more",not set,not set,"Jun 22, 2018",Hardcover,"May 29, 2018"

In this, Paige has escaped the prison camp of Sheol I but has become one of the most wanted criminals.What I likedI liked the story of her escaping and trying to settle in and make plans for the future, that was probably as far as I liked it.The development of Paige was incredible. I loved the way she started to be an individual by the end of the book and not scared of leaving Jaxon.Warden, oh Warden. I honestly read this book because of him and I loved every scene he was in.What I didn't likeWayyyy too much information, not much action. I went into this book hoping to see some kickass and fighting, I did not get that until the very end and was very disappointed. There was very little action and I felt as though it was just baby steps.I wish there were more scenes with the Warden because at times I just really wished we also got to see his perspective.The endingWas everything, even though it was shortlived.

No busca que la juzguen, solo que la escuchen. Y al hacerlo, muestra la fragilidad de un mundo que exige perfección mientras castiga la autenticidad.Su voz fuerte, contradictoria y humana me ha hecho pensar en cuántas veces elegimos lo que se espera de nosotros y no lo que realmente somos. En lo difícil que es sostener la verdad propia en un sistema que premia las máscaras.Con una sensibilidad nada forzada, el libro también nos habla del derecho a amar sin miedo, de cuerpos que envejecen sin permiso, y de la ambición como motor, no como pecado. Evelyn no pide perdón por sobrevivir. Y eso, a su manera, también es un acto de amor.También es un recordatorio de que lo bueno y lo malo no existen como absolutos. La vida real se juega en la escala de los grises, donde cada decisión se toma desde la urgencia, el miedo, el deseo o el dolor.

This is the book to give your parents to convince them that drugs aren't that bad... mmkay?His anecdotes seem hollow, he probably needs to eat more mushrooms (or LSD), but he had enough connections with people in the know to present the information accurately and effectively.Mostly free of religious taint. He sort of tries to explain how psychedelics work and presents some newer theories. Trying to explain how psychedelics work is as difficult as explaining consioucous and discussing the topic should be avoid unless you've spent considerable effort to understand what you're trying to explain. Even then you know you will get it wrong.If you know the history of and follow the new of psychedelics there won't be much new in here, but you should definitely give this book to your mom....more",not set,not set,"Jul 09, 2020",Hardcover,"May 17, 2018"

Not too flashy, nothing jumps out at you; it's not one of those books you can't put down. But it holds its own.

I loved every second of it.As always, Brandon Sanderson is brilliant. AltI got this book around lunchtime today. I finished it in an hour and a half. I loved every second of it.As always, Brandon Sanderson is brilliant. Although we are confined with Shai in her quarters for the majority of the novel, Sanderson is still able to paint us a brilliant picture of how the world works. I absolutely loved the magic system in this novel too; for some reason the idea of being able to rewrite the history of an object really appeals to me.I must admit, I was vaguely concerned that this book would not feel whole and finished, especially after reading Legion and feeling as if I only got half a story. This was not a problem for me with The Emperor's Soul. The story was whole; I didn't feel like I was missing anything. Sanderson left us at a good stopping point. And by the way, I loved the poetic symmetry of the ending. It was perfect.There was not a thing about this book I did't like. Sanderson, you have wowed me again.(view spoiler)[ Also, I am really interested to see the ramifications of Forgery in the Cosmere as a whole...I feel like this could have some very interesting effects, especially if you can Forge hemalurgic spikes so you wouldn't have to kill people anymore...or maybe the God-Metals...many possibilities here. Not entirely sure how it would work with any of the other magic systems in the Cosmere; i.e. I don't see it interacting easily with Breath or Aons, and we don't reallyknowthat much about Soulcasting yet...but anyway, that's something interesting to think about if you've read Sanderson's other Cosmere books. And if you haven't, then you probably have no idea what I'm talking about. Sorry about that. If you go read the rest of the Cosmere books and come back (and maybe also check out 17thshard.com), I promise this paragraph will make more sense.(hide spoiler)]...more",not set,"Oct 13, 2012","Jul 19, 2012",Paperback,"Oct 11, 2012"

Because Brandon Sanderson is aWords of Radiance is incredible. It’s one of those rare books that makes me wish I could give it more than five stars. Because Brandon Sanderson is a sneaky genius. And I can’t say anything else general without spoilers about this book because so many of the sneaky things Brandon did were at the end of the book. So don’t read the hidden part of this review unless you want massive, book-destroying spoilers. Also, most of it probably won't make sense to you if you aren't familiar with this series either, so if you haven't read Way of Kings yet, go read that and then go read Words of Radiance, andthencome back and read this review.(view spoiler)[Sanderson finally made me care about Shallan. As much as I liked Way of Kings, I felt more like I was just enduring Shallan’s chapters in order to get to the real heart of the plot. They were interesting, but the rest of the story was so much more interesting. I entered into this book expecting more of the same despite some things I’d heard from beta readers and the lucky bums who got ARCs. But then Jasnah dies (ha, nope), and the titanic weight of Jasnah’s project is thrust upon her. And she handles it. Exceptionally. I loved it. I think my favorite Shallan scene in the book was at the beginning when she saves the two caravans from bandits. That was pretty awesome.Also, I totally called the whole Jasnah still being alive thing early on. But then I kind of un-called it because of certain other protagonists Sanderson has killed off early in certain trilogies. So I guess I get partial credit for that? I was still really happy to see her in the epilogue with Wit.Also also, NIGHTBLOOD!!!!!! I was probably a little more excited to see him in here than I should have been, but ever since I became Cosmere-aware, I’ve been waiting for a noticeable main-character crossover. And before you argue, Hoid, Demoux and Galladon don’t count.I loved so much of this book and could go on for hours about my favorite parts, but there is limited space here, and I don't want to go on forever anyway, so I'll just give you three of my favorite parts of the book.1. Kaladin and Shallan getting some quality time in the Chasms. And also killing a Chasmfiend.2. Every one of Adolin's duels. Seriously. Dude is awesome.3. The final Kaladin/Szeth confrontation. If I had to choose an absolute favorite scene in WoR, this would be it. We finally get some answers about Shardblades and also get to see Kaladin fully unveil his awesomeness. And poor Szeth.(hide spoiler)]So basically, this book was awesome, and I will be absolutely shocked if it does not end up becoming my favorite book of the year. Even with Skin Game coming out in May. I plan on doing an immediate re-read at a much slower pace, but I only expect that to enhance my opinion of Words of Radiance. Truly an amazing piece of work. Congratulations, Mr. Sanderson.

The whole book is a persuasive argument made about situations where people generally have their minds made up about how they feel. Malcolm tries to say “let’s look closely at this for a moment” for situations where we have the privilege of retrospect. Someone does something bad and it looks bad but Malcolm says let’s look at the break down of this bad thing and let’s question the role of human judgement in that bad thing. This is not a simple argument to make. I felt myself fight back with this book a little. I think, at the end of the day, Malcolm did for me what he intended to do.

The main difference between the earlier books and these newer ones is that the newer books are community focused while the earlier ones were character-focused. He still does the same thing in all the books, he writes beautifully about human nature and causes you to think twice about people. I am giving this book 5 stars because I think it's a great book and I loved it but a part of me wants me to give it fewer stars because it is not nearly as good as his other books. At least not to me. I preferred when he was character-focused...more","Jan 03, 2021","Jan 12, 2021","Sep 12, 2020",Hardcover,"Jan 01, 2019"

I can't think of any other teen centring trilogy that I liked as much. I really enjoyed this book forI am a very big fan of the hunger games series. I can't think of any other teen centring trilogy that I liked as much. I really enjoyed this book for the added world-building. I appreciated getting some extra history about the hunger games and seeing it so close to its raw form and seeing how it evolved into what we read in the original series. I think this book will come off as an enjoyable read f you are a fan of the original series and want to hear more about that world. I don't have anything particularly critical to say about Snow's story. I find it easy to detach the idea I already had of him from this. I also enjoy reading stories about very complex and flawed character and what character more complex than a known villain.

Reading i""All seven-year-olds deserve superheroes and anyone who disagrees needs their head examined.""This book started and ended with the same line. Reading it, in the beginning, meant not very much to me as things mean little when you start a book. Reading it at the end caused me to chuckle the type of chuckle that becomes a small cry. It's the thing they say about what exists between the covers of a book, an entire story. I mean it is pretty obvious that a book will hold a story in it. What is never obvious and that you never expect is how important that story will become to you, how much emotions it will make you feel and how attached you will become to the characters in it - the characters of a story. So when at the end I felt a sadness, it was a recognizable one. It wasn't because of any heartbreaking event in the book (and this is not to say there weren't any heartbreaking events), it was because seeing those words ""All seven-year-olds deserve superheroes and anyone who disagrees needs their head examined"" meant I had come to the end. This sadness I felt is the sadness of having to say goodbye because while I knew they weren't real like the way people in stories aren't real, I also in a way knew that they were....more","Jan 2020May 13, 2019","Apr 18, 2020May 23, 2019","May 13, 2019",Hardcover,"Jun 16, 2015"

All around him, Julian sees mermaids: or women dressed as mermaids. Julian also sees himself as a mermaid and transforms by wrapping a curtain around himself to form a 'tail'.

She, in turn, takes Julian to a festival where many others are dressed as mermaids, (which upon later research is identified as the Coney Island Mermaid Parade).

I had seen the movie and felt that it was beneficial to see how Louisa, the main character, differed from her book counterpart. I loved the book then, and now reading it a second time I got a lot more out of it. Instead of comparing it to the movie I found myself more immersed into Will’s character. He is one of the main points in the story and the person that affects Louisa the most. It was important to me that when I read it this time through, I understood how Will’s decisions led him to his final actions. Although the book can feel tragic, Will is a very complex character and his progression through the book shows why he does what he does. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a love story that’s not like other books, and anyone who is ready to cry....more",not set,not set,"Nov 30, 2019",Hardcover,"Dec 31, 2012"

When the book first started, I wasn’t sure if it was going to captivate**spoiler alert** Wow, what a crazy book and elements that were so unexpected. When the book first started, I wasn’t sure if it was going to captivate me like I was hoping, but as the story progressed I couldn’t seem to stop reading it. The authors use of perspective and time manipulation really gives the book its mysterious nature. You get to see the almost obsession this detective has with finding Mia, the girl who’s been kidnapped, and you get to find out how much her mom wishes she would have stood up for Mia more. The most interesting perspective though would be the kidnapper, Colin. Throughout the story you can see that his thinking changes and his point of view takes a turn. Mia’s perspective is nonexistent through the book up until the last chapter, and you see that it’s because she knows more than she lets on. The author use of perspective was so smart because of reveals so much and gives a last unexpected twist. The time aspect is what keeps this book rolling, because everything is out of order snd switches off to before and after Mia is found, and then by the end of the book it seems as though it meets in the middle and everything makes more sense.

It is clear that a lot of this book is about the painA central idea that I think could be seen, is the pattern of heartbreak and loss to resiliency. It is clear that a lot of this book is about the pain that she feels when during these hard times. It’s one of the hardest things to notice that a relationship is starting to diminish, and there is nothing that you can do about it. You can see her struggle with this in the book and see that she longs for the way that things used to be. But then at certain points in the book just when you think that this is her breaking point, she rises back up to the top to claim her life as her own. She realizes that she doesn't need the love she thought to be happy. It’s a clear cycle of this.The way that Lang Leav uses her words is a very beautiful thing. In the book she often uses metaphors or similes to show her symbolism. In one of her poems “From a Dream” she states the way it felt to love this certain person by comparing it to waking up from a dream, and the few seconds after it. It really helps to put things in perspective. Something that really influences her imagery is her personification. Many times she likes to talk about people like being the sun and the moon. One place you can see this is in her poem “Reclaiming the sky”, where she sends a powerful message about rising up and claiming what is rightfully yours.This is a really great book. I’m usually not the type of person that sits down with a book full of poems, but this surprised me. It’s such a trip to see these stories go on such a ride of emotions. You see heartbreak and loneliness, all the way to being on top and you don’t need anyone to make you whole. It’s almost empowering to see that no matter how low things get, things can still look up and change. I can tell from this book that Lang Leav has an amazing way with how she uses her words. She takes time to perfect and execute her ideas....more",Apr 2019,"Apr 09, 2019","Apr 11, 2019",Paperback,"Jan 09, 2018"

Sloane has recently gone missing along with her familSince You’ve Been Gone, starts out by talking about one of the main focuses of the book, Sloane. Sloane has recently gone missing along with her family, only leaving behind a to-do list for the main character Emily. The only way that emily can think of to bring her best friend back is to do the list of things that are normally way out of her comfort zone. So, she starts with the small things. Through this journey, Emily never expects the full ride of emotions and new opportunities that she is going to find, along with discovering herself.I believe that the main romance of this book is very believable. You can see that at the beginning of this book Emily is very introspective. She has a hard time connecting to people and getting out of her shell to finish the list, which is why I think it’s good that Morgan Matson didn’t go too fast with the relationship. She gives a good amount of time so that Emily has a chance to get to know herself a little first, before throwing her into a relationship. It makes this book a lot more meaningful, because it’s not so far out that you can’t relate to it.I really love this book. I think that Morgan Matson does a great job of showing character development through Emily. One thing that I think is subtle but makes the book more personal to the author is the song mix’s that Frank and Emily make for each other. It is a great way to incorporate some of the things that the author loves while also making it valuable to the story.

Mostly, she focuses on the houses that she passes on her daily train ride and the people that live in them. Since she has not actually met these people she takes note on what they do everyday, and makes up her own version of what their life is like. She takes particular interest in one family that she believes has a perfect life. When the girl, she calls Jess, doesn’t show up for a couple days, she starts to worry just enough to investigate.The author, Paula Hawkins, loves to throw flashbacks in there when she knows that, without it, the book wouldn’t make sense. This adds a lot of suspense because until you get the whole story, you can’t make a prediction about the ending. She goes into such death that the book goes on pretty long before you can really get the plot of the book. Paula Hawkins does an amazing job with manipulating the time. The ending has a big surprise and can get confusing if the person reading does not pay enough attention.I really enjoyed this book but at a couple of points it got a little long. Before all of the action has started the author takes a long time to get to the point. Of course, that can be caused by the fact that a lot of background information is needed to understand why Emma is the way she is and really get the depth. The reader has to pay a lot of attention to the detail or else you will get lost in the story.

He escapes the miserable world he lives in and enters into a virtual world where he feels powerful and important. This is an epic journey for Wade. He has an opportunity to find the “easter egg”. This would change his dire living situation living in the trailer park. This is a story where the underdog wins and moral courage is rewarded. There are many great examples of Wade’s moral courage in the book. One example is when he went into the headquarters of the sixers. These are the main villains in the story. The Sixers’ goal is to get the easter egg as well but they cheat and use other selfish methods. Real-life, not the VR world Wade goes into the Sixer’s HQ and hacks them form the inside which saves his friends in the end. He risks himself to save another. This book is very captivating and has a great message of friendship, love, and courage.

These kids are strange not only in their personality, but also in their physical traits as well.The author of the book that I am reading creates mystery and suspense by multiple of the main things that create suspense. One of the big things that the author uses is pacing. She uses pacing in multiple ways. She uses it in the whole book. And she also uses it in the way that she tells the little stories within the main book. Another one that she uses is telling the story out of order. She jumps a lot and you are always wondering what happened next and/or what happened to the person or character that she switched from. The author also uses a lot of the gothic characteristics. One of the ones that she uses is with the characters. The monsters in the book have red eyes and are often hidden except for the telltale signs. She also does unexpected twists in the story. I have gotten really excited about something in the book because I think that I know what is going to happen, but then she throws something completely different than I was expecting.My opinion of the book that I am reading is a good book.

I didn’t think that was possible, but it was! Sarah Crossan and Brian Conaghan tell a beautiful story through beautiful poems. It had a romantic, whimsical feel that came from the poems. There was imagery, sensory detail, metaphors, similes, euphony, and foreshadowing. Each poetic device added to the story and made it interesting. The poetic devices helped develop the theme by brightening each of the character’s voices. When there was a specific moment the authors wanted captured, they were able to do so with poetic devices.I really loved this book! It was amazing for my first novel in verse that I read and I love how different the style is from actual novels. The authors were able to bring the characters to life and there was never an empty moment.

I do agree that this was a super fun, warm, heartfelt read, like most of the reviews say.This book was so cute! The main characters had a perfect romance that made my heart melt. I only gave this book three stars though because I feel like it missed the mark on a few points. First I think that some of the subplots needed to be fleshed out more or completely removed. They didn’t add anything to the story and left me confused. Also, this book was very superficial feeling for me even though it tackled some ‘deep’ topics. I think that Poston could have added more emotional depth to the characters. Overall, if you are looking for a cute, sweet, quick read, this book is for you....more","Mar 20, 2019","Mar 22, 2019","Feb 24, 2019",Hardcover,"Apr 04, 2017"

He causes disruptions wherever he goes and wants to finish his final year of school in peace. That doesn't happen when his roommate, Baz, comes back to school two months late looking like a complete wreck. While Baz was gone, Simon got a message from Baz's mom. They may hate each other, but they are forced to work together (and maybe realize their feelings for each other).This relationship was amazing! Simon and Baz are obviously meant for each other, even though they pretend to hate each other. While the relationship is set in a fantasy universe, I find the relationship believable. There were a few moments when I thought that they would never get over their misplaced hatred for one another, but as they talked and really got to see each other in a new light, they fell head over heels for each other. Overall, I thought it was a beautiful, believable, and for the most part, realistic relationship.I loved this book! As I mentioned above, the relationship that unfolded throughout the book was soft with the perfect amount of angst.

It is told from the perspective of Lena, who is living with her aunt and has been since her mom committed suicide. Her best friend Hana trespasses into a laboratory and convinces Lena to go with her. Together they meet a guy their age, Alex. Lena and Alex have some obvious chemistry, Alex attracted to Lena, and Lena not sure if she trusts him. This starts Lena’s realization that the government may be corrupt in making love against the law.Lena is very complex and changes in major ways throughout the book. She starts by being a strict law abiding citizen and believing everything the government told her. Through her dreams about her mom’s suicide and Hana, she starts to explore the flaws of this society, and the benefits of not following the laws. It is a gradual then almost immediate change. Lena starts slowly breaking laws, and then all of a sudden does not believe in them at all when she falls in love with Alex.Delirium is a book that I really enjoyed reading. The characters had good development and the plot continually surprised me. There were a few lulls were it took me some time to get back into the story, but overall the book kept me intrigued. The author, Lauren Oliver was very good in showing the meaning behind simple phrases. Because of this though, she used a lot of similes. Almost every paragraph could be found with a simile of some kind starting with the phrase ‘as if’ or ‘it was as though’ etc. Once I realized this, it was hard to not notice every single one and that made reading slightly more distracting for me. Overall, this book was very interesting and was written in a way that I had not yet experienced, but I hated the ending. Absolutely thought it was awful.

The main character David is a teenager looking for adventure and revenge. The biggest thing in the book, in my opinion, is the author shows how much David grows when faced with new and some difficult things. He starts out as a rookie just barely making it into the reckoners' group. He learns a lot throughout the book and the author shows it well.My friend wrote a review that mentioned how many plot twists there were and how they added a lot to the story. In my opinion, he’s right. Without the plot twists, the book would have been really boring to me. Another thing he mentioned was the fact that there are so many morals introduced and a book with good lessons is always a bonus for me. Someone else noted how great an admirable the author is and I think he is an absolutely amazing person too based on how many spectacular books he’s written.In my opinion, this book is well rounded like the characters inside of it.

In Hidden Figures three African American women proved their smarts and worked hard to be able to work on the Nasa space team, in which later they got to watch the rocket fly into space. In these times the white race was not nice to the darker race, in ways that were utterly unnecessary. If these women had not worked hard they would not have gotten where they were, their hard work had paid off.2. I think the the word that stuck out the most was “underestimate”. I say this word because the whole story behind this book was four African American women getting the chance to work with Nasa on the space launch, and this was set in the time where the whites were said to be the best race. The darker skinned people were treated poorly and often times called names such as dumb. But these women proved to those around them that they could be just as smart, or smarter than they are. The words definition in the dictionary is “estimate (something) to be smaller or less important than it actually is” which is slightly different than the meaning that was given in the book. In the book they use it as not being capable of doing something so they thought down on them.3. I loved this book because of how strong the novel showed emotion. While reading the book it left you connecting to all the characters in your own way, as well as sometimes getting frustrated with certain people in the book. It was fun to read because it also taught you a little history lesson about how the African Americans had been treated.

Abnegation; the selfless, Dauntless; the brave, Amity; the peaceful, Erudite; the intelligent, and Candor; the honest. Beatrice is currently living in the Abnegation sector, and like the temperament that describes the Abnegation, Beatrice is no different. The main character of the book, Beatrice Prior, turns sixteen and the big day comes for her to take the aptitude test and leave her family and join a new faction. The aptitude test is a test that determines one's skills and abilities. Whatever the sixteen year olds score on their test determines which fraction they can join out of the five. After Beatrice takes the test her results come back being Divergent, which leaves her not being to fit into just one fraction, but a bit of all of them. From there on out she has to hide her results to save her life.In the beginning of this book Beatrice was very selfless, just as her fraction raised her to be. She was also very shy and stayed in very close quarters of her comfort zone. As the book progressed, Beatrice was no longer Beatrice. She now went by Tris in her new fraction of the brave, the Dauntless. By the first day she was there she was already taking massive steps outside her comfort zone. Being in Dauntless meant confronting your fears and trying to overcome them, learning to fight, and get to the top of your class. Tris knew that in order to make it out alive she had to make it to the top, so she did just that. She pushed her boundaries and continued to fight. She became a stronger person and was no longer the shy little girl she had started out in the beginning.I thought this book was very impressive with how it was written and how every turn was unexpected and exciting. Most of the chapters of this book had left you on cliffhangers, which I really enjoy. They always seem to get me more indulged in the book and not want to put it down. I related to Tris Prior and most of her thoughts. When I read about her I always thought about myself thinking about the spot she was in, or had been in the past and how we were alike. There were other characters that I also thought I had a close connection with such as Christina and Four. All the characters were very different and their personalities ranged from various scales, which were really fun to read about.

After the death David did nothing but prepare for the day he would get his revenge. He was determined to learn everything he could about epics (people who'd been gifted with powers) and their weakness, all epics had one. However he could not do it alone, so he set out to gather all the information he could on the Reckoners, the only group of people who was willing to fight against epics and their evil reign. It took time but he finally found where one of their operations would be and was able to join them. He convinced them to go after higher more powerful epics, unlike previous ones they'd killed in the past. They saw a great risk in this but also saw a great win. Killing higher epics in Steelhearts territory would draw him out and give them the opportunity to attack him. The only problem was, they didn't know his weakness. David had seen him bleed, it was the reason his father had been killed. his father had wounded Steelheart, but how had he done it? David could not figure it out until the day game where he was face to face with steel heart. Him and the Reckoners and drawn him out, pretending to be an epic that was there to challenge him. They were being defeated but David would not back down. He faced Steelheart and realized how his father had wounded Steelheart. It had not been intentionally, he'd been trying to save Steelheart from another epic because his father believed that the epics were supposed to be their to help them. However that was not the reason he had been wounded. It was because he had not feared Steelheart. After David came to this realization, he too lost fear for Steelheart, and so, he shot. Killing Steelheart.Though I did not go into a lot of detail I really loved this story because one, I love anything that incorporates special abilities or powers and this book does that. Not only that it gives these powerful beings a flaw, a way to be beaten, and just the way the characters have to figure these weaknesses out and execute plans to exploit the weakness is amazing. It's a fun book with great characters that you can relate to, whether its challenges their facing, or emotions their feeling, you really just get that shared connection. Another thing I enjoyed is that it is well paced, it doesn't start you off with that great intro and then just explain to you day by day everything David is up to. It incorporates his time since the events of his fathers death well into the story on later pages. Fitting in with the events that are taking place.I gave it a five star rating not because it's about humans with powers and gadgets, though that does play into the reason, but because it is a well crafted work that balances its self out with character developments, setting description, background information, and great twists that when re read can leave you thinking, ""That makes so much sense now!"", ""That's why they were the way they were!"".

It follows the story of Will, a teenager who just witnessed his brother get murdered. The place he lives has three rules passed from father to son: don’t cry, don’t snitch, and avenge a loved one’s murder. With these rules in mind, Will wipes the tears before they can form and heads to where he thinks his brother’s murderer is, gun in his belt. However, once Will gets into the elevator six dead people from his past enter the elevator one-by-one and tell him how they met their demise. The author beautifully constructs these encounters, allowing the encounters to build up impact until the final two words of the story. It is shown that each of these people reveal a flaw in Will’s plan. It starts out with Buck, who shows Will isn’t prepared, then Dani who reveals Will’s reluctance to kill someone, then his uncle Mark, who exacerbates Will’s reluctance to kill, then his dad shows up and reveals that he followed the third rule and killed Mark’s killer, but killed the wrong person and got killed by the victim’s family. Frick is the fifth person to enter, and it is found out he is the one who killed Buck and was killed by Will’s brother, and someone from Frick’s gang killed Will’s brother to get revenge. Lastly, Will’s brother walked into the elevator but says nothing to Will. When the elevator reaches the lobby, everyone disappears except Will’s brother, who walks out of the elevator and says two words: “You coming?”.

Very often the second book has a filler feel; meaning, it doesn’t really add to the story, it merely fills pages. Prodigy on the other hand, was interesting, it introduced important new characters and filled many of the gaps presented in Legend. I enjoyed the authors writing style, I loved how the chapters alternate between Day’s perspective and June’s perspective. I really enjoyed when they both have different takes on the same situation. The unique writing of the two main characters truly feels individual, making the characters seem realistic. Prodigy and the Legend series is really captivating.

This resulted in the purity wars, a war between the genetically pure (people without genetic changes) and the genetically damaged (individuals with altered DNA), this war devastated billions of people and greatly decreased the Earth's population. Fast forward several decades, after the purity wars, and the bureau of genetic welfare has tried to undo the alterations in human DNA. They have done this by creating enclosed areas where the damaged individuals have their genes corrected and then pass down the whole genes to their children, and create a new population of genetically pure individuals. Tris and Tobias come from one of these genetic experiments, but in this city the society has collapsed and innocent people are being killed by the government. Tris and Tobias escape Chicago with a group of friends only to find that the world outside their city is just as corrupted if not more than the place they just left. Now they must choose their morals, choose who they trust, ultimately choose the fate of every person they know and love.Tris and Tobias are very interesting characters. They experience devastating loss and mind boggling moral dilemmas as the plot thickens. With their challenges they only grow stronger and more individual. At the start of the story they find themselves struggling to sort out their opinions and moral standpoints and throughout the book become grounded in their values. Eventually they make up for past and recent differences and complications and grow to have a stronger less controlling relationship which Tris really struggled with. As they develop and the plot thickens the couple learns the importance of standing for what they believe in without making rash decisions.Allegiant and the entire divergent series were very fun to read, I loved the moral delmas that the characters faced. The plot was fascinating, as the story progressed my excitement and intrigue in the story increasted. The love story between Tris and Tobias was unbelievably annoying, their relationship was unrealistic and the continual circle of fighting was frustrating.

At the bridge he dies he is resurrected into the norse or viking afterlife having made it into Odin's great hall, Valhalla. He proceeds to get his Valkyrie out of Valhalla and then escapes valhalla on a quest for the sword of summer. He runs around the nine worlds of norse mythology meeting giants sea monsters and various gods. He meets famous figures in norse mythology such as Loki, Thor, Odin and Freya.Most people on Goodreads said they wanted Magnus Chase to be Annabeth's, one of Rick Riordan’s characters in the Percy Jackson series, brother. I don’t think this is true and another reviewer said this which I think made a great point to the separation, putting Magnus as Annabeths cousin allows for easier connection to Percy jackson while also keeping the series somewhat separate. Most of the reviewers on Goodreads want Percy Jackson to be in this series right away I completely disagree. It’s not bad to have a connective universe but there's a point where a connective series and constantly bringing it around like this gets annoying. Authors should be able to make their own stand alone series when an author constantly has to fall back onto an earlier series and books it makes the series weak. This isn’t shared by others my personal opinion doesn't make sense to me but I guess they like the same thing over and over again.It’s a good book and does a better job at keeping to the true norse mythology than most with a few liberties such as Geirod and his daughters who in norse mythology were killed by Thor. The character is relatable and has a great personality. On of my biggest problems with this series and Rick Riordan's books in general is the insistence on crossovers and the main character having an algorithm the character starts out good but by the end of the first and beginning of the second is basically just another Percy Jackson. By the end of this book his character loses what made him so good in the first place and it seriously reduces the books quality.

Obviously you can’t understand everything because not everyone has cancer, but you can see where they are coming from. Now somethings aren’t very realistic, but it’s a romance novel so what else can you expect? No one has that perfect relationship. This however, doesn’t affect my opinion of the book at all. I thought it was a good book. All romance books have unrealistic relationships so I was expecting it as I went into the book.I loved this book. It wasn’t just a love story though it was a story about loss and hardships. I think that is one of the reasons why the book is so loved and well known.

Michelle had to fix the way that she acted and talked around certain people. Michelle goes talks the reader through her life starting at the begin when she was a kid living in the south of Chicago to her being one of america's most famous first ladies.An idea that was repeated in the book a lot was “be who you are.” Michelle faced a lot of obstacles that challenged who she was. At times it almost got to her but she never let those obstacles change her identity. The dictionary has two very different definitions for the word identity. One is “the fact of being who or what a person or thing is.” This is the definition that Michelle is trying to get across. The second one is, “a close similarity or affinity” this definition is the exact opposite of what is implied in Becoming. In the book she talks about not being the same and being her own person. What I find as interesting is that one word could have two completely different meanings.I honestly loved this book. I learned some things from it about Michelle and some things about life.

Together they find out the true reason of how Lula Landry died.Robert Galbraith used the point of view of the characters to move the story along in a way that the reader could understand. When the characters would tell their stories, it was like a flashback so that the reader could see what was happening. Throughout the book there was twist and turns. You never knew what was going to happen next. There was always new information being found in every chapter.To me The Cuckoo’s Calling was a bit boring. It was very repetitive.

The story follows X, a pretty sophomore growing up in the hood, as she struggles with her parents’ and church’s views, when her’s and modern society’s views are vastly different. Her parents are very devout Catholics, and they feel that it is a sin for her to date and have a boyfriend. The poem tackles many problems that today’s teens face such as parents, attraction, religion, and sexual orientation.

This book is about a society who has an operation or procedure that is performed once you are 18 that makes it so that you can’t love anymore. They think that love is dangerous and can get people in trouble. They think that their society is safer without love. It takes place in Portland, Oregon, during sometime in the future. The problem of the story is, Lena wants to follow the rules, but her friend, Hana just wants to break them. She convinces Lena to go to parties, listen to music, and even interact with boys, which eventually leads Lena to fall in love with Alex, a boy she met at a party.Lena develops throughout the text by the way that she thinks. In the beginning of the book, she talks a lot about her mom and how crazy she was. However, towards the end, she starts to view her mom as someone who maybe saw and understood things that most people didn’t. Lena starts to see these attributes in herself. She is also very worried and concerned with breaking the rules, because she just wants to live an average life and not be anything special. She doesn’t want to be out of the ordinary, but in the end of the book, she starts to realize how messed up her world is. She even allows herself to fall in love, which leads to all kinds of trouble. Lena interacts with other characters throughout the book by talking to them and openly sharing her opinions and thoughts with them.I could relate to Lena throughout the story because she just wants feels pressured to do things right and she doesn’t want to get in trouble. Lena doesn’t want to have to deal with anything that could keep her from getting the procedure. However, Lena starts to rebel and kind of not follow the rules, she is less uptight and just wants to have fun. She leaves her worries behind her and lets herself fall in love and have fun, even if it means she is breaking the rules.

She got kidnapped and held hostage for nine months when she was only 14 years old. The book describes her as in a living hell. She suffered everyday and didn’t know if she would make it to the end of the day. She was terrified and lived with fear of the unknown.The word I chose was taken. This is one of the most used words. She talks a lot about how she is being taken away from her family and from her freedom. The definition of taken is reach for and hold. I feel like this could go with the book because he reached out and took ahold of her. So in a way it correlates but on the other hand I feel like a better definition for the book would be to take possession or something.I loved this book. It was so good.

The story is set in 2045 when the world is on the brink of collapse. ThFor English class, I chose to read the novel Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. The story is set in 2045 when the world is on the brink of collapse. The main character Wade Watts finds refuge in the OASIS, a virtual world allowing him to forget the one he is in. The creator of the OASIS, James Halliday recently died, leaving behind a contest to retrieve his fortune and claims to the OASIS company. The contest includes several puzzles and clues used to unlock three gates and ultimately find the prize. When Wade becomes the first person to find the copper key, the race begins, and players are willing to do anything to reach it. The novel is loaded with references to TV shows, movies, video games, technology, and sci-fi of the 80s-the time when Halliday was a kid.After reading Ready Player One, I read some reviews from other readers. All the characters are flawed in some way or other, but the novel does a good job of turning it around and bringing out some of their redeeming qualities. Some readers claimed it was unbearable to see kids in the 2040s reliving the 80s. I felt the book glorified the 80s a little too much, and it seemed like everyone went along with it as if they did not have a mind of their own. Some readers pointed out that Ernest Cline really knows his stuff, being someone who experienced the era. Though I found myself in information overload, I enjoyed it because it demonstrates a fan making a tribute to his ideal time period. One reviewer pointed out that the writing of the first half was flat, and many references were merely name-drops. I agree with this statement, because there are numerous occasions he mentions something and never brings it up again. One review stated that Cline made an observation that our world is heading toward a future with increasing loneliness and a digital world more vital than reality. I feel this is true, as it seems our civilization is heading farther from face-to-face interaction and more to virtual reality and more online relationships. Another review I found brought up Wade’s unhealthy relationship with Art3mis. I felt he became a stalker after their break up, and he tried to make her feel bad about her decision. I think this resulted from their solely online relationship, the Egg hunt, and his obsession of her.I had a great time reading this novel. Though I did not grow up in the 80s, I have had several influences from that era, and am familiar with some of the movies and music. I loved the elements of the contest incorporating old arcade games. I enjoyed how deep the book delved into the culture, exploring things such as anime and TV shows. I found the characters interesting, with some surprises along the way as the characters met each other in person. However, I felt the novel was almost one-sided at times, and things tended to blend together into seemingly nonessential facts about the 80s. Wade as a character had a sufficient background, but I would have liked to see more about Art3mis and others. I also found Wade’s break-in of the IOI headquarters slightly unbelievable. I found the battle between the Sixer forces and the Gunters at Anorak Castle was momentous, and I loved how it incorporated old anime mecha such as the Leopardon and Mechagodzilla. I also found it exciting to see the Wade use the Ultraman Beta Capsule. The read went by fast, and it maintained interest until the end. There were a couple plot twists, and I found the relationship between Art3mis and Wade different than I expected...more","Mar 16, 2019","Mar 23, 2019","Feb 28, 2019",Hardcover,"Aug 16, 2011"

The beginning shows the pain and heartache she went through as a child iThe main idea of this book is opposition and finding strength to overcome it. The beginning shows the pain and heartache she went through as a child in relation to family and self image. As the story progresses and more things seemed to go wrong, her anger seems to increase as well. This anger stems from those close to her dying and betraying her. At one point in the book, she falls in love and her tone becomes less depressed and more lighthearted. The last section of this text is written in a second person style wherein the author expresses the ability we all have to overcome our trials.The book is obviously filled with poetic devices. The author uses a fair amount of cacophony in the beginning of the book, showing her struggles and pain as a child. She used this device to express her anger with her neglectful mother and her struggles with weight and self disgust. When she meets the man she loves, she uses more euphony in her writing as a result. Some of her writing is metaphorical including one poem in which she describes freckles as a universe. The title itself is a poetic device, foreshadowing the fact that her story gets better and she does begin to find herself.I didn’t really like this book. It was annoying to me that the author covered the front in, “the Princess Saves Herself in this One” then proceeds to write about how her boyfriend “saved” her. I understand anger and frustration, but the tone of this book came across as kind of petty sometimes. I respect the pain she went through and the strength it took to overcome her trials, but I don’t love how she so fully blamed the world. All she seemed to do was feel sorry for herself. I think she did have good reason to feel hurt and sad, but her reactions seemed petty and childish instead of trying to find something to do any real good. While that is how I feel about it, I also understand some people cope that way and I believe if it helped the author to overcome her struggles, it’s good....more",Mar 2019,Apr 2019,"Apr 22, 2019",Paperback,"Apr 23, 2016"

However annoying he may seem, there is more to him than there appears. By mistake, the movie star begins texting Elle. As they get to know each other over the phone, both get increasingly attached to each other.The romance is partially realistic, but in a lot of ways it isn’t.

The first, Verity, is a special operative for the British military. Maddie, her best friend, is a pilot. When the two are shot down over France, Verity soon finds herself captured by Nazis. Tortured and interrogated for weeks, she makes a plea agreement which requires her to write a volume of pages that covers her time in the British army. Her papers give insight into the friendship that developed between herself and Maddie.The novel provides powerful themes centered around love and friendship. It highlights the fact that love often requires sacrifice and can lead to pain. It accentuates selflessness and what it can lead to. Throughout the book, Verity appears self serving and weak because she gives information to the Nazis. However, readers discover that she suffered immense pain and was willing to die for her cause. This cause was her original mission, destroying the hotel where she and other prisoners were held. In addition to Verity, Maddie shows selfless love at a pivotal moment in both her and Verity’s life.I literally bawled while reading this book. In my philosophy, if a book doesn’t leave you better when you finish it, it isn’t worth reading. I love books that make me think and feel--this one certainly fit the requirements. It drove me to ask myself who people really are and if I’m fair in my view of them. In Code Name Verity, every character had a story. Elizabeth Wein creates people who aren’t meant to be hated. They’re meant to be real. For example, even the Nazi captain has moments of humanity. Readers can see his uncertainty when it comes to his daughter. The book pushed me to question my own selflessness towards those I love. The scene that probably touched me more than any other, was one in which Maddie confesses to Verity’s brother, Jamie. Of all the people I love most in the world, my brother is very near the top, so this moment hit me especially hard. Jamie’s love and forgiveness is tear-jerking. I really appreciate this book. I do wish one could just skip through the first two thirds of it, while still understanding the context.

Um dem Ganzen eine Chance zu geben, bin ich auf´s Hörbuch umgestiegen. Und das ich mir das bis zur letzten Minute angetan habe, ist nur der unglaublich guten Vertonung durch Torben Kessler geschuldet. Dem Mann höre ich einfach gern zu.Eins vorweg: Ich mag emotionale Bücher. Ich mag Bücher mit einer schweren Thematik. Ich mag Bücher, die zum Nachdenken anregen und auch meine Sicht auf die Dinge verändern. Ich mag auch Bücher, die Krankheiten thematisieren; insbesondere psychische Erkrankungen. Aus diesen Gründen habe ich zu diesem Buch gegriffen.Und ich fand es tatsächlich interessant, wie Judes psychische Erkrankung dargestellt wurde. So sehr ich manchmal auch genervt von ihm war, konnte ich seine Denk- und Handlungsweise durchaus nachvollziehen. Psychisch Kranke geben nunmal nicht gern zu, dass sie krank sind. Sie reden sich gern ein, dass sie gewisse (gute) Dinge einfach nicht verdienen. Sie meinen, sich immer selbst bestrafen zu müssen. Und es ist unfassbar schwer, an so einen Mensch ranzukommen, geschweige denn ihm helfen zu können.Mir war das Buch allerdings von Anfang an viel zu langatmig erzählt. Außerdem wurde die Handlung zunehmend unrealistisch. Das ganze Buch habe ich als eine schlichte Aneinanderreihung von Grausamkeiten empfunden. Das wurde irgendwann so unsinnig, dass ich das Ganze gar nicht mehr ernst nehmen konnte. Spätestens ab dem Kapitel, in dem man die Ursache für Judes Gehbehinderung erfährt, hab ich nur noch mit dem Kopf geschüttelt. Und ja, ich habe mir oft die Frage gestellt, was im Leben der Autorin passiert sein mag, dass sie das Bedürfnis verspürte, so eine Geschichte niederzuschreiben und einer fiktiven Person so viele Grausamkeiten anzutun.Auch stört mich, dass es in dem Buch nur schwarz und weiß gibt. In seiner Kindheit begegnet Jude fast nur Menschen, die böse sind. Die seine Schwäche ausnutzen und ihm nur schlimme Dinge antun. Da ist kein einziger Mensch, bei dem er Schutz findet. Zumindest nicht in dem Maße, wie man sich das für ein Kind wünscht. Und plötzlich ist er erwachsen und schon sind die bösen Menschen verschwunden. Plötzlich sind (fast) alle gut zu ihm. Wollen ihn als Freund, lieben ihn und zeigen ihm, wie wertvoll er ist.Und ich finde es schade, dass über all die Jahrzehnte, die man das Leben von Jude und seinen Freunden begleitet, eigentlich nie auf eine Lösung hingearbeitet wird. Alle schauen dabei zu, wie Jude an seinen Seelenqualen zugrunde geht und sich selbst verletzt. Andy flickt ihn immer wieder zusammen, aber auch er kommt nur ab und an mal mit dem erhobenen Zeigefinger um die Ecke. Oder Jude wird mal angeschrien, wenn er es mit seiner Ritzerei zu sehr übertrieben hat. Ja, es ist schwer, so einem Mensch zu helfen, wenn er das selbst nicht möchte. Aber tatenlos dabei zusehen kann doch auch nicht die Lösung sein.Was will mir das Buch also im Endeffekt sagen? Das die Welt voller perverser, pädophiler Männer ist? Dass der Freitod die einzige Lösung ist, wenn man mit seinen psychischen Problemen nicht klarkommt?Ich wünsche jedem, der das Buch mag, dass er für sich etwas aus der Geschichte mitnehmen konnte. Ich kann leider gar nichts daraus mitnehmen. Von daher ist es entgegen meiner Erwartung einfach kein Buch für mich und ich persönlich würde auch niemandem empfehlen, das Buch zu lesen. Denn alles, was nach dem Lesen bleibt, ist nur ein unfassbar bedrückendes Gefühl, ohne Mehrwert....more","Aug 21, 2021","Aug 27, 2021","Apr 26, 2021",Paperback,"Mar 10, 2016"

This book is a part of a series of books, called the Red Rising Series. In this universe, man-kRed Rising by Pierce Brown is a science fiction novel. This book is a part of a series of books, called the Red Rising Series. In this universe, man-kind has become interplanetary, and to maintain order, people have been split into genetically altered colors, with each color being genetically modified for their ‘purpose’. In this hierarchy, the Golds are at the top, with the Reds at the bottom. Every colors’ purpose is to serve the Golds in different ways, and Reds are the poorest of the poor. In this series, a young man and the main character Darrow goes from being a Red to a Gold, with the resolve to take down this hierarchy.To do this, Darrow has modifications to his body to become as strong and powerful as a Gold, but only because his willpower was strong enough for him not to die in the process. However, Darrow has to battle his mixed feelings of guilt and pleasure while having to adjust and befriend the Golds that now surround him. Will Darrow prevail against the tricks the Golds play on him, or will he become one of them?Overall, the best aspects of this book are its imagery, attention to detail, and realistic character development. On top of this, the author deploys these aspects in a manner that contributes to the story at a maximum volume. Because of this, I rate this book 5 stars....more",not setnot set,not setnot set,"Jan 03, 2023",Kindle Edition,"Jan 28, 2014"

His ""Codex Alera"" series is also evidence of that. The novels of the ""Dresden Files"" have successively increased in quality since ""Storm Front"", and this one has certainly not broken the pattern. ""Cold Days"" is Butcher's best novel yet. Harry Dresden and his compatriots have become well-developed, nuanced characters with personalities as subtle and complex as yours and mine. Butcher continues to take classic themes and villains of the fantasy genre and transition them smoothly into the contemporary era, as well as anthropomorphizing the superhuman. In ""Cold Days"", Butcher throws Dresden into yet another horrific circumstance to deal with, and just when we think Harry has got things under control, crazy twists happen. Butcher yet again throws curveballs that draw on plot elements across the entire series. If these twists weren't planned in advance, all the more credit to Butcher for telling captivating stories while keeping the series contiguous.This book, like the rest of the series (yes, including ""Storm Front"",) is a worthwhile, exciting read, leaving the reader exhilarated and drooling for more....more",not set,not set,"Mar 28, 2013",Hardcover,"Nov 27, 2012"

Therefore I was given access to a copy through NetJust to preface I was chosen by the lovely people from Fierce reads to be on the Alice street team. Therefore I was given access to a copy through Net galley . This is my honest review and reflects only my personal opinions regarding the novel.This novel delves into the gritty underbelly the malicious high school gossip and achieves this by giving us us the perspective of four different students connected to the main character Alice who is the epicenter of the rampant rumors. The torment and the tension that surrounds Alice feels authentic and the voices of the rotating povs are distinct. The one small flaw however was that that every element also limits the reader's connection and investment to the characters.I give it four stars for the powerful message it delivers and the very clever way it goes about doing so. People judge Alice by the fragments of feelings that they take from their peers, and the reader is placed in that very role in which they must discern what kind of person Alice truly is from the thoughts and actions of of the 4 povs....more","Mar 21, 2014","Mar 28, 2014","Mar 21, 2014",Kindle Edition,"Jun 03, 2014"

It lived up to the promise of a cute story, but compared to The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight, it was a bit boring. I think the main issue in the book was the pacing, there were these interesting elements of love, family and secrets but, it never really came to a satisfying climax for me. it kind of sputtered into it's destination, yes some drama occurred but I was hoping for something with a bigger punch.On the plus side the characters are nice and rounded and I liked that it was not so wishy washy and that the two main character's Graham and Ellie had their own goals and hopes for their lives separate from the love aspect of the story. They also had their own familial struggles in the novel that helped to give them more dimension a reliability, I just wish that this was expanded on a bit.Overall it was a fun, quick read that does not bum the reader out, so it you are looking for something lighter but with mild character conflict then you will probably enjoy it.This Is What Happy Looks Like...more",not set,"Feb 13, 2014","Feb 14, 2014",Hardcover,"Apr 02, 2013"

Nothing trips me out more than having differing cover art style amongst book in a series!The Plot- Without giving any major plot twists away ( and believe me there are a lot of juicy ones!) the reader in thrown into a very rich Fantasy, in which our heroine Alina must take on very dire circumstances to ensure her safety. There is a lot of build to the third act but the pacing is good and does not drag. The character's that we met in the first novel have grown and evolved (some in good ways and others not so much). Mal is fleshed out even more and this adds some nice dimension to his and Alina's burgeoning relationship.My favorite elements of this however were the new characters that we meet along Alina's journey, many of whom are not what they claim to be. This added a whole new layer of intrigue. Additionally I enjoyed the whole political game element , that although mentioned in the first book is given a grand introduction in this sequel. Lastly the Darkling is most definitely back and brings massive amounts of drama and questionable actions with him ,as you do when you are a massively mysterious character.The entirety of the novel has action, big reveals and good character conflict, which I appreciated since many second instalments in trilogies suffer form the cursed ""second book syndrome"" although the Author uses the page space in Siege and Storm to set up the finale the book does not suffer under that weight.I gave it 5/5 stars for character growth,enjoyable/ steady plot progression .

Lale was the tattooist because ""somebody had to do it"" & it might as well be him. His justification was that the work would be easier, he might be gentler than others and most importantly he would survive & I applaud him for that. He saved food for others, especially his love interest, but, some of the story just did not add up and that bothered me. I wish I could have felt more empathy for what he was going through - where was his compassion for others? He seemed a bit too happy to be a Jewish male at Auschwitz.

The story goes back and forth from when Victoria was 10 to present day when she is 18 and on her own. She has always felt unworthy with a huge hole inside her longing for her place in the world and longing to feel loved. Victoria's only comfort is through flowers, they are her passion. She communicates best using the ""language of flowers"". There was an amazing wealth of information about flowers and their meanings in this book. The story comes full circle when Victoria is faced with motherhood and the overwhelming task of not knowing what to do, being all alone and knowing this is probably exactly what her own Mother may have faced when she had abandoned her as a baby.

You don’t have to know a thing about NAGPRA to read this book; Boulley will tell you everything you need to know through her characters.The characters are tenacious and inspiring.

If one calls your name, or the other tempts you off path, you must ignore both or face your wrath.”Liz left her hometown as soon as she could and never looked back. She returns for her best friend’s wedding. When her niece, a young black girl, goes missing in the woods, a white rust belt town’s dark past is revealed. She’s not the first to go missing, and Liz starts to notice a pattern taking her back to her youth when her only black girlfriend also went missing, in these same woods. Every white person is a suspect, and, each is believable.A little horror mixed in with some supernatural and a critical examination of racism that still exists to the point that no one can be trusted.This is an incredible debut and I loved how different this book felt. Some have said unconventional and I think that’s a perfect description. It has that same eeriness of Such a Fun Age, and similar betrayal. Our main character does all the “wrong” things in a horror book but she really shows her strength and determination through it all in the name of black girls past, present, and future. I can’t wait to see what this author does next!(Not for the faint of heart. This book is descriptive about death)....more","Nov 03, 2022","Nov 06, 2022","Aug 20, 2022",Hardcover,"Oct 04, 2022"

Ariadne helped Theseus defeat/kill her brother the Minatour and then fled the island with Theseus, betraying her family and especially her sister Phaedra who helped Theseus as well. But Theseus takes Ariadne to Naxos island and abandons her, leaving her alone with her thoughts. This retelling of Ariadne’s story really places a spotlight on the women of the stories and the realistic struggles that these women faced, some a lot like what women face to this day. The book was easy to get into, easy to stay with, and overall really enjoyable.I loved that womanhood was explored and will leave you with a quote:“I had hit upon a truth of womanhood: however blameless a life we led, the passions and the greed of men could bring us to ruin, and there was nothing we could do.”...more","Jul 05, 2022","Jul 09, 2022","Jan 31, 2021",Hardcover,"May 04, 2021"

A quick read that I think a lot of people will find relatable and enjoyable considering the times.

Andrew and I always felt that way too - we value it so much. Jenna’s connection with all of her grandparents is so sweet, and not unlike my own. I really enjoyed that. I know how fortunate we are to have our grandparents in our lives still, and even more fortunate to have spent a lot of time with great grandparents as well.Favorite quote: “It isn’t courageous to do the right thing.” Barbara Bush (former First Lady).

Instead, we had a story of a poor German boy who died in the camp because he found a friend.This story does the opposite. It tells us the true story of Lale, about the love, the torture, and the people that he had to go through while he was at the camp. This story shows every part of what he had to go through and includes the story of his wife who he had met at the camp and who had survived the camp and how they had to find each other again after escaping auschwitz.The story also includes the before and after of the time he spent at the camp, and it's a sad and terrifying experience to read about.The book is so much better because it's coming from someone who had THE most inside knowledge of how the camp was run, who was in power, he had connections which he had to make in order to survive and help the other prisoners at the camp. He has told the story that will not only keep what had happened during the war alive but also will keep his love story alive for decades to come.I highly recommend this book and don't take the 3/5 as a negative sign, I'm very strict with my rating and this is a very high rating compared to the other books I have read. This book is going against some of the most famous and loved classics there are.Again, READ ITTT....more","Sep 26, 2024not set","Sep 26, 2024not set","Sep 14, 2024",Hardcover,"Sep 04, 2018"

It reminded me of a Freida McFadden book, but more monologue. I didn’t hate this book despite it making me really angry multiple times. Mostly the writing style and choices in the book.Author would be writing up to a pivotal moment and end the chapter just for the next chapter to start off in the future and look back on that moment in hindsight. Incredibly irritating as a reader. Many flashbacks. Too many.So. Much. Monologue. I found myself skimming some of it.I predicted the end around 50 pages in. The ending was not satisfying.I gave it three stars because I liked the idea and plot of this book, I just thought it could have been executed better.

My favorite Stockton family member is Sasha; I found her most relatable and rooting for her throughout. I feel like Sasha could have played a bigger part in this story. The other characters were harder to connect with due to privilege, snobbery, and being out-of-touch. The Pineapple Street house represents something different to each character and the complex, family dynamics made this story difficult to put down.

I didn’t find it believable at all, but maybe it has to do with the age of the characters.While I liked the characters, in general they felt one dimensional and some even felt like different people in the first half of the book vs the second half. In the beginning Iris was independent if not stressed and frustrated with how her life was going, but by the end her entire life revolves around some guy??? And she was constantly afraid unless he was there to be strong and comfort/motivate her? No thanks.Also, for a book about a magical war between gods the only magical items we really got to see were typewriters. And even those weren’t critical to the story by the last third!The writing was lovely, but by the end I just wanted the book to be over.

Dans ce romaCarry on est un livre particulier : il est une fanfiction de « Simon Snow » écrit par Cath, l’héroïne de « Fanfiction »de Rainbow Rowell. Dans ce roman, on suit le quotidien de Cath lorsque sa vie connaît un grand changement : elle quitte le foyer familial pour faire ses études à la faculté. Sa sœur jumelle avec qui elle avait une relation très fusionnelle, refuse de partager une chambre avec elle. Cath se retrouve donc à devoir s’approprier un nouvel environnement, de nouveaux cours, de nouvelles relations sociales et amoureuses. Elle est fan d’une série de livres « Simon Snow » et en attendant la sortie du huitième et dernier tome, elle écrit une fanfiction à succès « Carry On ». L’histoire de Cath est alors entrecoupée de passages des livres « Simon Snow » et de sa fanfic, cela nous permettant de découvrir l’univers magique où évoluent Simon et son ennemi Baz. Lors de cette lecture, je m’étais fortement attachée au personnage de Cath, mais également à ceux de Simon et Baz. C’est donc avec plaisir que j’ai découvert leur univers ainsi que l’histoire finale « créée par Cath ».Le début du livre a été un peu déroutant pour moi, dans le sens où il a fallu s’approprier un univers que je ne connaissais pas alors qu’il est supposé être connu par « les lecteurs » de la fanfic de Cath. J’avoue que le fait d’avoir lu Fanfiction il y a deux ans de cela et de ne pas l’avoir relu avant « Carry On » ne m’a pas aidée… Cependant, Rainbow Rowell arrive à poser rapidement le fonctionnement du monde magique de Simon Snow, ainsi que les liens entre les personnages et les enjeux de l’histoire.L’univers de Simon Snow est fortement inspiré de la saga Harry Potter, on y découvre ainsi de nombreux points communs. Simon Snow est un orphelin « Normal », il n’a eu connaissance de ses pouvoirs magiques qu’à 11 ans, lorsque le Mage, « the Greatest Mage», le directeur de l’école de magie Watford fait de lui son héritier, lui révèle qu’il détient un grand pouvoir magique et le fait rentrer dans l’école pour ses études. Le monde de la magie est alors en guerre contre un ennemi particulier, « The Insidious Humdrum » (la monotonie rampante) qui tente de supprimer la magie en Angleterre. Pour autant, Simon Snow évolue dans un environnement très contemporain où les magiciens possèdent téléphones portables, télévisions, etc...Cependant, Simon se révèle un piètre magicien, il a du mal à jeter des sorts, comprendre le fonctionnement de la magie et la contrôler. Cependant, à des moments critiques, il est capable de réaliser des sorts révélant un grand pouvoir magique. A l’école, il est obligé de partager sa chambre avec Tyrannus Basilton Pitch, « Baz », soupçonné par Simon d’être un vampire et qui devient son pire ennemi. Simon devient très ami avec Penelope Bunce, une magicienne aux grands pouvoirs qui devient une alliée indispensable. Il a également une petite amie, Agatha Wellebelove.L’histoire de ""Carry On"" commence donc dans cet univers supposé être établi depuis 7 tomes. Le livre débute avec l’arrivée de Simon à Watford pour sa 8ème et dernière année. Cependant, son retour ne se passe pas comme prévu et Baz est anormalement absent.Tout au long du livre, les péripéties vont s’enchaîner jusqu’au final de la série telle qu’elle est imaginée par Cath. L’intrigue est assez complexe et les personnages ne sont pas manichéens, en proie à des décisions qui peuvent aller contre leur postulat de base. Le fait que les chapitres correspondent au point de vue des personnages permet de mieux les comprendre. Cependant, la psychologie d’un personnage, Agatha, me semble moins développée, moins logique. Mais j’explique cela par le fait qu’on est supposé lire une fanfic où l’auteure efface un peu ce personnage pour en mettre d’autres en avant.Au niveau de l’écriture, on découvre un vocabulaire parfois peu politiquement correct (fuck, etc…) qui détonne avec le vocabulaire qu’on lirait dans un livre jeunesse. On y découvre également de l’humour et des références, notamment dans les sorts jetés par les protagonistes : « Simon says » (la version anglaise « Jacques a dit »), « Have a break, have a kit-kat », « These aren’t the droids you’re looking for » (en référence à l’épisode 4 de Star Wars)... Et encore, je pense que mon niveau d’anglais ne m’a permis de comprendre tout l’humour présent dans le livre. Toutes ces libertés sont permises par la pseudo-écriture d’une fanfiction et cela est agréable à lire.Je retrouve en effet beaucoup de caractéristiques présentes dans les fanfics que j’ai lues à l’époque d’Harry Potter. Rainbow Rowell arrive ainsi parfaitement à utiliser les codes d’une fanfic pour donner beaucoup de crédibilité à son livre. On arrive à s’approprier rapidement l’histoire inexistante de 7 tomes et à prendre du plaisir à lire ce « faux » huitième tome.J’ai passé un moment de lecture agréable grâce à une intrigue complexe, des personnages intéressants. Je pense que mon avis est aussi lié à ma nostalgie : j’adorais lire et écrire des fanfics autour de Harry Potter avec des amis, en attendant la sortie des tomes de la saga. Je pense notamment à la fanfic « Les portes » de Alohomora dont j’attendais impatiemment la suite, mais également les fanfics de Lychee, les fanfics Harry/Malefoy, Severus/Sirius, etc…Carry on est un livre vraiment à part : un roman écrit pour être une fanfiction et qui est totalement réussi. Je pense cependant que pour bien apprécier ce livre, il est nécessaire d’avoir lu « Fangirl » auparavant....more",Jan 2017,"Jan 02, 2017","Jan 02, 2017",Hardcover,"Oct 08, 2015"

Lorsque l'histoire commence, Cath fait son entrée à l'université et quitte ainsi son cocon familial. Ce passage de l'adolescence à l'âge adulte est d'autant plus difficile que sa soeur jumelle, Wren, aspire à plus d'indépendance et a refusé de partager sa chambre universitaire avec elle.On va ainsi suivre Cath lors de son année universitaire et partager avec elle son évolution entre cours, amis, amours, famille et fanfiction. Les relations aux autres sont décrites avec beaucoup de réalisme, comme on avait pu le découvrir dans Eleanor et Park (livre plus récent mais sorti avant Fangirl en France).Outre le caractère attachant de Cath, l'omniprésence de la fanfiction apporte un plus à cette lecture qu'on a envie de poursuivre sans s'arrêter.Je me suis ainsi replongée quelques années en arrière lorsque je lisais les nombreuses fanfictions autour de Harry Potter et que j'attendais impatiemment la suite de la fanfic ""Les portes"" écrite Alohomora...C'est donc avec plaisir que j'ai lu l'histoire de cette fangirl à l'université....more",not set,"May 26, 2015","May 27, 2015",Paperback,"Feb 18, 2015"

I gave Beauty Queens by Libba Bray - one of my favorite authorsReads back. 'Hmm... Interesting.'I read this as an audiobook from my public library. I gave Beauty Queens by Libba Bray - one of my favorite authors 4.5 stars because I love the theme and the message just not all the sexual things which weren't very many. The book was short and spicy. That sound wrong. Short and sassy. Better much better.Okay here's my review.50 girls are on a plane to a deserted island to host the Miss Teen Dream Beauty Pageant. The plane crashes and 13 survive. The 13 girls have to survive on a plane without food and water. The island has secrets and so do the girls.My favorite character is between the main character and a minor character. Adina and Tiara. I can relate to both despite Tiara's humorous stupidity. She was very dumb but very funny. You got to see as the book went on that she was more than just a girl who was stupid.The characters are very realistic and I want more. The story keep me guessing about what each girls secrets were and I would had never guessed that it was the secret it was. My favorite part was the ending. Not because it was over but because it was amazing and super funny. All the scenes were written beautifully. The book made me laugh a lot and brought me to tears. One of the best books I've read all year. I couldn't put it down.I found it difficult to like any of the other characters beside the main one at first but I think that was the point. When the Pirates came I didn't like the fact that Adina hooked up with someone she had JUST MET.I would suggest non homophobic teens to read this awesome and funny well written book. Libba Bray has not failed me yet. If you have a low romance tolerance this book is not for you. But still read it. Also for feminists everywhere.Libba bray is also the author of other series I recommend by her. Beauty Queens is a 9.8 stars out of 10 stars. I just didn't like all the romance to be honest....more,"Sep 26, 2015","Sep 28, 2015","Sep 26, 2015",Hardcover,"May 24, 2011"

Now when it comes to the romance, I absolutely loved it. It felt organic and genuine the way it went from a friendship to love in a way that was not rushed and felt honest, and as readers we were able to really feel the same emotions at the same time as our main characters. The main characters were really nice ans quite relatable and despite their own issues they were able to pull through and form something beautiful.

When I first received this book, I didn’t think I’d reDon’t judge a book by its cover has never been truer than it is for this one – at least for me. When I first received this book, I didn’t think I’d really like it all that much but boy was I wrong. It was marvelous and pretty funny too. Both the writing and the drawings were clever and funny. There isn’t really a linear story, but instead Brosh looks back on and recounts stories from her childhood to adulthood while providing her present insight on those stories. Some chapters don’t even tell a story but instead are just her thoughts about her life and herself. The lack of a linear story and focus makes the book seem a bit choppy as it goes from chapter to chapter, but I think it works well because it seems to match her train of thought, and her voice. Speaking of her voice, though, Brosh has a great one! She is bittersweet and piercingly witty. Her voice was probably the highlight of the book for me. She really had me cracking up, especially in the “Goose Dinosaur” chapter, the hot sauce chapter, and the cake chapter, and the ones about her dogs. Okay, I picked out a large majority of the book there. That tells you just how funny I thought it was. Her drawings were perfect matches for the stories as well and were also just as funny. Beyond the humor, Brosh also approaches huge topics in her book questioning identity, looking into her depression and personality introspectively. She sort of forces you to consider your own identity as she so openly explores her own....more",not set,not set,"Jun 06, 2016",Paperback,"Oct 29, 2013"

I wanted more pages, to see how Jacqueline’s story continued. This book was, again, not my typical selection but it became a wonderful read. I loved watching Jacqueline grow up and develop as a person as well as a young writer. She had such an interesting but sincere voice and her personality, memories, and thoughts were all displayed so well throughout the pages of the novel. Beyond the captivating story, it also included so much depth and history. Everything in this novel just felt so unique yet very real and authentic at the same time. I recognized a lot of the injustices she witnessed in her lifetime and felt as if I was learning a lot from this very young character whose voice, again, was just so brilliantly rendered. Although I didn’t live through anything like her in regards to the time period or the oppression, I was able to appreciate the ways in which she showed them to us readers. I loved the parts in the South because I, too, had many similar experiences growing up in a more Southern, country location. It was beautifully described as the “home” I’ve always known and loved. Speaking of “homes,” though, it was also interesting to see how her young character explored and negotiated this idea of “home,” and what makes a place a home. It was a great topic that really had me thinking about my own homes. Lastly, I loved the way this novel was written with the haikus and the poetry. Again, it was so unique feeling.On the last page of the novel she brings up all of these pieces of her life and says “All the worlds you are…gather into one world called You” and that truly is the essence of this great novel (320). She tells her story, inevitably encouraging you, as the reader, to consider your own story, your own homes, your worlds that gather into one world called You. I simply loved it....more",not set,not set,"Jun 02, 2016",Hardcover,"Aug 28, 2014"

Down to the cover, it seems like the perfect novThe entire time I read this book, I couldn’t help but think about how my little sister would love it. Down to the cover, it seems like the perfect novel for a younger girl who swoons over a sappy love story. It almost calls out to young girls. Described as a young adult novel, I can see its appeal to the teen or maybe even the youngest adult. I mean, it’s pretty relatable to someone growing up and it offers a look into what almost all young girls dream about, young love. But there are also the cliché “cliques” with the mean girls/guys, the high school drama, the low self esteem issues that are common in any coming of age novel, and of course, that eye-rolling love story I mentioned. These very elements make the novel feel somewhat relatable to anyone, but especially the younger audiences. However, in some ways it also felt a bit too mature for the intended audience. The language was often harsh and there were frightening abusive moments in the novel. It is true that several young people go through these issues as well, but I guess I felt it to be beyond both Eleanor’s and any young person’s maturity. In the end, it wasn’t my favorite novel ever. To be fair, though, it isn’t a novel I would typically read and I felt a lot of the dialogue/plot to be cheesy, overdone, and unrealistic. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend the novel either but I will say that I understand its appeal to the younger audience - of ladies especially....more",not set,not set,"May 30, 2016",Hardcover,"Feb 26, 2013"

As I read the book, I was first and(Contains Potential Spoilers- Read Cautiously)It's hard for me to muster the right words when reviewing this book. As I read the book, I was first and foremost extremely grateful that I just so happened to have double majored in English and Religious Studies in undergrad. I say this because of the large amount of name dropping and theory that is discussed with little introduction behind them. If it hadn’t been for my own educational background, I wouldn’t have recognized much of what Eugenides brought into the novel let alone appreciate some of the ideas and moments that I could actually relate to as a student of those disciplines. Still, there were moments I didn’t recognize names or ideas and realized how that might be the case entirely for other readers of the novel. I’m glad I was able to find some appreciation in some of those instances where other readers might have felt alienated.Nonetheless, I am a sucker for a good story in any medium so I read expecting to get one out of this novel. It kept me relatively interested some of the time, but as I read the final page in the novel, I realized I hadn’t gotten the story I was hoping for. I had sort of been rooting for Mitchell for awhile being the character that had developed more authentically in my eyes and yet, the novel has a pretty unsatisfying ending which left me wondering what the purpose was for much of the seemingly redundant, excessively unnecessary details throughout the entire novel. In the end, my greatest take away from this novel is that Madeleine, a main character who is a woman, is heading off to be independent and presumably successful in academia, which was nice after seeing her be tirelessly dependent while suppressing her intelligence and talents through much of the novel. Seeing her break away from that repressive state of living was refreshing. Still, I guess I wanted more out of this novel and I just didn’t quite get it.The novel does, though, offer interesting looks into mental illness, religion, gender roles and challenges, education, drug and alcohol abuse, consequence, and much, much more. In the almost 800-page novel, many, many, issues are brought to light briefly while others stay present throughout the entirety novel. I almost wish there had been less in order to have focused on the few, more – if that makes sense. It’s as if this book attempts to tackle too much at once, rather than focus strongly on a few important ideas....more",not set,not set,"May 27, 2016",Hardcover,"Oct 11, 2011"

LockhartIn this Realistic Fiction/Romance Drama, I deduced a major lesson that all of us could learn: The characteBook Review of We Were Liars by E. LockhartIn this Realistic Fiction/Romance Drama, I deduced a major lesson that all of us could learn: The characterization of a family by a group of people may not always be true especially when a perfect family is far from what is considered to be perfect. A lesson like this is important for people who become jealous of the rich as there is not a single person who doesn’t go through something.Cadence Sinclair is the eldest grandchild of the wealthy and esteemed Sinclair family. She is of 3 older children of the Sinclair family: her cousins Johnny and Mirren. Along with these three, there is a child named Gat who lives with Johnny as his uncle is in a relationship with Johnny’s mother. Together, these four make up the “Liars”. Within Cadence’s fourteenth summer, or “Summer 14”, Gat and Cadence fall in love. However, it is later found out during Cadence’s fifteenth summer that Gat is dating someone else.Cadence decides one summer evening to go out for a swim and hits her head on a rock. This event leads to her having chronic, severe headaches that eventually lead her getting addicted to Percocet, a pain-relieving drug used to fight her headaches. Her mother, perceivably wanting to avoid her daughter’s troubles, forces her daughter to go on a Europe trip with her father during her sixteenth summer. Upon returning to the island in Cadence’s seventeenth summer, much had changed to the island including the estates and the people in them. Inheritance became a struggle between the daughters of the patriarch of the family, Harris, and the daughters were having their kids suck up to Harris. Not wanting their family to fall apart, Cadence and the other Liars hatch up a drastic plan.I found the book to be a bit too slow-paced. The format of the book allotted for time skips occurring between every couple of chapters which made it seem like a lot of time was going by without anything of importance occurring; not to mention the fact that very little got done to resolve the conflict until the end of the book. To your average reader, including myself, this becomes very annoying and makes the book very boring. However, it must be noted that much of the book was spent with Cadence trying to collect what happenedRegarding what I found to be one of the themes of the book, I felt that the author was very able to communicate what it was. First, on the first page of the book, Cadence states, “WELCOME TO THE beautiful Sinclair family. No one is a criminal. No one is an addict. No one is a failure.” (1) Already, she is stating that she has a perfect family because she puts this facade that nothing is wrong with her family. It is known that this statement is a facade because the author, through the voice of Cadence, hints at the major events that occur throughout the book “It doesn’t matter if divorce shreds the muscles of our hearts so that they will hardly beat without a struggle. It doesn’t matter if trust-fund money is running out; if credit card bills go unpaid on the kitchen counter. It doesn’t matter if there’s a cluster of pill bottles on the bedside table. It doesn’t matter if one of us is desperately, desperately in love. So much in love[,] that equally desperate measures must be taken”(1). Such a family that is described by Cadence would not have these problems if they were beautiful or for lack of a better term, perfect. However, when Cadence tells us of these problems, she sarcastically tells us this by using the phrase “It doesn’t matter” as if to say that despite these things, her family is still perfect. Furthermore, the fact that she thinks the family is perfect at all is not true because towards the end of the first page she states this, “We are Sinclairs. No one is needy. No one is wrong. We live, at least in the summer, on a private island off the coast of Massachusetts. Perhaps that is all you need to know”(1). Saying that “Perhaps that is all you need to know” means that we as an audience may only need to know that the Sinclairs are the things that are shown in this quote. As we are not a part of the family, we have no reason to care about what goes on within the family thus not having to care about the truth of what goes on in the family besides the superficial things that the family presents itself to be. This ties directly to the theme of “The characterization of a family by a group of people may not always be true especially when a perfect family is far from what is considered perfect” because we as the audience before reading this book would have thought that the Sinclair family was perfect just because we only got to see the surface level characteristics. However, by just reading the book and even these quotes, we get to understand the true nature of the Sinclair family and how imperfect they are.The author was able to communicate this theme through her use of the characters of the story. Mainly, she used a character named Gat and another character, his uncle Ed, to share how imperfect the perfect family of Sinclair is. Firstly, the subtle bigotry that came from Harris, the patriarch of the family, was shown throughout the book; a characteristic like this is not something the Sinclair family should have when Cadence says, “We are old-money Democrats.”(1) Modern Democrats, even old-money Democrats, shouldn’t have an ounce of bigotry in the blood. Harris’ bigotry’s influence becomes apparent when Carrie, one of Cadence’s aunts, refuses to marry Ed in the fear of losing her inheritance, “‘That’s the thing,’ said Gat. ‘Everyone’s always asking Harris about everything. Why should a grown woman have to ask her father to approve her wedding?’/ ‘Granddad wouldn’t stop her.’[said Cadence}/ ‘No,’ said Gat. ‘But back when Carrie first moved in with Ed, Harris made it clear that all the money earmarked for her would disappear if she married him.[ ]The point is, Harris doesn’t like Ed’s color. He’s a racist bastard, and so was Tipper.’”() The author often uses Gat as a spearhead to question the accuracy of the perception that everyone has of the Sinclair family. In this instance, she is using Gat to question the notion that the family is rich as a whole. He makes us aware that the control of the money is centered only on one person, the patriarch, and that all of his daughters have to appease him in order to keep their inheritance. Another example of her use of Gat was when he talks about the true definition of the Sinclairs as a beautiful family, “He knows he’s not supposed to be that guy. He’s a Democrat, he voted for Obama—but that doesn’t mean he’s comfortable having people of color in his beautiful family.”() What Gat references is Harris’ true belief of what is considered to be a beautiful family, in that, the entire family is ethnically homogeneous: white. Harris worries that if Gat and Gat’s uncle, the people of color in which Gat is referencing, become a part of the Sinclair race, it will ruin his “beautiful” family. As readers, before reading the book, we thought that the Sinclair family was described to be beautiful because they were all attractive; we now know that they are meant to be beautiful because the family has no variation in their ethnicities. While the author described Gat as political, and he surely was so, she didn’t overuse him to the point where he was only political. He was the romantic interest of the main character, and he was her emotional anchor.While this book was clever in delivering its message, it did not change any of my opinions or views. This is because it shares the same views as I do in relation to the income inequalities we experience on our planet. I do not find it fair that the rich can get away with murder(figuratively) and the average person cannot.This book was able to make me think a lot because of how unstraightforward it was. I understand that the speaker was unreliable, and that I had to take what she said with a grain of salt. As a result, I’m only willing to recommend this book to people who like to think.With all of what I said in mind, I would give this book 4 stars....more",Oct 2019not set,Oct 2019not set,"Oct 28, 2019",Hardcover,"May 13, 2014"

How music companies made money in the 80s and 90s is outrageously different from how they make money now.

The book had an incredible Agatha Christie feel to it, reminding me a lot of Murder on the Orient Express. That was the thing I liked about the last Ruth Ware book I read.

There is almost no plot (literally NOTHING happens) and instead the entire premise focuses on the inner thoughts of and external relations between an employer and her nanny. The racial conversations were so continuous and overt and not from the perspective of the main character, which the book promises to be about. Show, don’t tell. Give the reader an interesting quandary to think about or create a situation that lets them think for themselves instead of regurgitating the same tired points.The most interesting part of the book is about 60-70% of the way through when the main character describes her inner conflict between how she feels about the job and where she feels she is supposed to be at her age.

Nor did it make me feel like a terrible person if I did not agree with every word of the text.It DID make the ideas/concepts accessible.

I don't regret reading it, but I felt like it could have done so much more. The premise sounded so interesting - paranormal-ish reimagining of the the voyage of the Donner Party. The subject matter was interesting enough to keep me engaged. By the end I had mostly figured out who people were, but it took me almost the whole book to figure out who belonged to which family and who was just a cattle hand/driver and how they were connected. I did enjoy that we got to see that(view spoiler)[many of these characters had hidden pasts.(hide spoiler)]There were certainly scenes that captured the horror - namely(view spoiler)[the scene with unknown sounds of BEINGS outside a tent full of family and children and the scene where a young man gets his ear ripped off.(hide spoiler)]However, it didn't really seem to do enough or the plot didn't resolve them spectacularly. I felt the emotion of the parents the most. Think of being out there in that wasteland and trying to figure out how to make sure your children survived. Shudder.For me, the ending was misleading based on information that we were given at the beginning of the book. We're told that(view spoiler)[there was only one survivor at the beginning of the book, but then the ending doesn't seem to match that.(hide spoiler)]There were also aspects of character developments/characteristics that didn't seem fully resolved to me. Why does Tamsen(view spoiler)[engage in a sexual relationship with Stanton? Is it just bc she is so unhappy? Was she just trying to get physical pleasure. The book made it seem like something was really going to come of this and then it seemed like when Stanton moved on with his new love interest, Mary Graves, nothing more seemed to come of their relationship...? /spoiler>In the end, it was just missing a little punch on the horror part and the cast of characters was pretty complicated. But, I did enjoy the overall idea of giving the historical happening a paranormal feel. I do appreciate all the research that the author did regarding the daily life and struggles of the pioneers.Also, I did minimum of research on the subject was pretty shocked to read that the rescue efforts carried almost as much peril as did the original journey!

I do this this is perhaps mis-marketed as a ""thriller."" It doesn't have that instant gratification that most thrillers start out with some kind of punch like finding a body or a kidnapping scene or something of that nature. This is probably better classified as a horror book and the pacing is more reflective of that, in my opinion. Yes, the ending was a bit of a whirlwind, but I was fully captivated and on the edge of my seat!There is definitely a slow burn in the beginning of setting this really tense atmosphere and dropping these small bread crumbs of information about things that just don't ""feel right."" There is a scene with a young woman and a lyft/uber type of driver that is *cringe* so creepy.I didn't predict most of the twists at least to some extent. For example,(view spoiler)[I knew that there was something going on with Sydney's mom and that something was off there, but I never would have guessed that she died in her own home and then Sydney buried her in the community garden!DUDE.(hide spoiler)]Also, love all the social commentary on this book regarding racism and the interaction of community members and how what you say and do can really be impactful to those around you. Gentrification is a real issue and it's so complex and this just makes that topic more personalized and human. Perhaps it will open some eyes, as it did for me. Also think that is why this was so creepy for me bc it just didn't seem like much of a stretch for this to be happening! And it was so linked in to true history of the area that it doesn't take much to see how that really could happen. Obviously, it's fiction, but you get the idea.There was a great reading discussion video posted on BooksandLaLa's YT channel where some young women of color reflected on the book and certain scenes and I would highly recommend watching that after reading the book. Their perspectives were really enlightening for me!Now the one thing I could have done without is the fairly gratuitous sex scene, but listen. That's kind of a horror thing, right? If we consider this a horror and not a thriller, then maybe it's a little more justifiable why that scene is included. It's a Basic Instinct type of vibe.

The scene setting and the characterization were amazing! This is being compared to the writings of Agatha Christie and I certainly understand that. Here we have a true mystery with suspense thrown in to up the ante.From the beginning, we are aware of a death, but we don't know who has died or the circumstances. Then we jump into chapters from our main characters, each being written from their POV. Now, I know some people don't like multiple POV and this one had several, but I did not mind it at all in this case. The characters were easily distinguishable for me and each added their own perspective and mood and important details that all combined to make a fab story. I loved that each chapter had some HINT of something ominous or mysterious. I absolutely turned aside other books that I was supposed to be reading for book clubs in order to read this. Definitely had that ""un-put-down-able"" quality.Now, I will say that around 40% complete I actually recorded a list of predictions about how the book would conclude and I would give myself a 65-70% accuracy rating with those. So, the story was just a hair predictable. HOWEVER, those predictions were in regards to the secrets each character carried and I definitely did not have a workable theory for what ACTUALLY HAPPENED AT THE WEDDING. So!

I was shocked to learn that this was a modern setting for this story and that there are many women where this is probably a close adaptation of the reality of their lives.

But, honestly, that didn't lower my enjoymentUltimately, this book was a lot of fun! I have to knock off one star for believability factor being low. But, honestly, that didn't lower my enjoyment of this a super ton. Our protagonist, Pip, decides to do her senior capstone project on the disappearance of a young girl in her home town. Due to his general kindness toward her, she does not believe that the young man accused of the crime is guilty and she decides to investigate further. I thought it was cool how she saw an ""every day"" hero in him.I really enjoyed the two main characters, Pip and Ravi, the brother of the alleged criminal. They are just that brand of adorable awkward and still witty that is just the most fun to read. I really just let the story unfold without trying too TOO much to guess the perpetrator. The turn of events did get pretty thrilling and suspenseful. Definitely a rollercoaster ride.Now, the reason I knocked off one star. There were a few too many things I felt were holes in the novel. I mean, the whole concept that a teenager could uncover aspects of the crime that the police could not is one thing. But also(view spoiler)[ the motivation behind the crime was a bit weak bc Mr. Ward seemed to contradict himself about the repercussions of his crimes. The way her parents calmly accepted that she went to confront someone she suspected was a killer all on her own.She figures it out, GOES TO HIS HOUSE ALONE and they're just like...hmm...ok. Yep. No consequences and not even a discussion. And then she does it AGAIN when she knows there is more to the story and goes to confront another person and that just seems like SUCH a poor decision!(hide spoiler)]But these were balanced out by the overall exciting progress of the book and what I felt was a really good mystery. I also loved the(view spoiler)[speech that Pip gives at the end of the book which discussed how the community needs to do better so these terrible circumstances don't happen again.

The book held our attention throughout, for the most part, and also allowed for some really great discussion. We were both drawn in enough to offer our guesses about the plot and WHO is the guilty party in all the various crimes. We were definitely kept guessing and were not successful in guessing the final points until the very end of the story - just as it should be. We also really enjoyed the podcast sections of the book and felt like they meshed well with the overall story.This book facilitated some discussion between us about rape and assault and how women are affected. How people think of the victims and all they must endure both in their communities and legally. The trauma doesn't stop until long after the actual event/assault. As parents of a young girl, we could really relate to the characters of the victims parents, who were forced to decide how to approach her legal situation.Note for readers - in this novel, you're really following three timelines: the crime in the past that was committed against the ""stalker's"" sister, the podcaster's current day work to cover the rape trial for her listeners, and then the timeline of the trial's featured assault itself. So if you don't prefer multiple timelines, this may not be for you.In the end, we did knock off a star because the book did feel a bit long at some points and it was a bit difficult to keep all the various time frames straight.

Each scene moved the story inexorably forward to that breaking point in the plot - the point where everything comes to a head. The title of the book was purposeful, the chapter titles the same. The characters were fleshed out and well-developed. The themes were so powerful and far-reaching and the symbolism and story-telling devices were so well done.This is a horror novel, so let's not wax TOO poetic here. For me, the novel did not disappoint on the horror factor. There was gore, there was suspense, there was all those feelings of disquiet or ""offness"" that were SO effective. All of the horror seemed so BELEIVABLE for me, so it's no wonder I found myself shuddering and jumping at the slightest noises around me as I was reading (and listening).This book was written so well that the jumps in time frame did not bother me and I was able to keep the characters straight throughout. Every time I had to put this book down (damn you, work life and boo to these little humans taking up so much of my time!), I would look forward to picking it back up again.I have listened to and read several reviews and interviews with the author and with Native readers and it does seem that the representation is lauded and appreciated. Thank you, SGJ, for providing a window into the culture of of the reservation and into the thoughts and feelings of those Native folks from a reliable source. Also, I both read this book and listened to the audio book and I highly recommend the audio book too.The only reason that I docked a half a star was due to the basketball scenes in the novel. For me, these scenes became long, too complicated/technical, and repetitive. That being said, after some research and even while I was reading the novel, I understood that basketball is a very important part of reservation life for many people. So, while I still must account for my personal taste in writing a review and providing a star rating, I also understand the purpose for including the sport in the novel. I also understand that the(view spoiler)[basketball game at the end of the book really allows the author to portray the struggle that the characters are facing. As opposed to having a ton of internal dialogue for example, or a really long conversation that would spoil the momentum of the ending.(hide spoiler)]Overall, I would highly recommend this book to fans of horror.

However, as someone who is new to the genre and is is still somewhat intimidated by it and easily frightened, I didn't mind that at all. The beginning section of the book sets up the relationship between the two main characters and helps make the rest of the novel believable. It's what allows the reader to really feel the connection between and TO these characters, especially the MC, Abby.There are definitely some high-power (read gross) horror scenes, you just have to be a little patient for them.(view spoiler)[ There is a scene where a huge tape worm comes out of a young girl that is just BLRUG and another at the beginning of the book involving a naked teenage girl running through a dark wood and getting lost and finding a deserted shack that really spooked me too, among others.(hide spoiler)]I have a special affinity for this author as he weaves societal commentary into his stories and this one is no different. In this novel, there are instances where:(view spoiler)[1. a low income GIRL tries to alert various types of authorities that she believes her friend has been raped and no one listens to her, 2. the parents/school teachers are too offended by the scuffing of their sensibilities to listen to any kind of negative talk about the child of the school's wealthy donors, and 3. the underestimated (read marginalized) mother of a child speaks up and SHUTS down those trying to prevent her child from achieving success.(hide spoiler)]I loved the tenacity of Abby and her determination to do what's right, despite the huge obstacles in her path.

I read An Anonymous Girl and was not all that impressed with it. However, I had a different experience with this one. I did not see the ""big twist"" coming except for maybe just a hint or piece of it that I starting to think about in the last quarter of the book.The writing style is pretty simplistic and not super evocative. There was not a lot of character growth. I also kept getting several of the characters confused and found it hard to keep their stories/identities straight. For those reasons, I did knock off a star. But all in all, this was a good story and I think that's what the authors were really focusing on - keeping you wondering how this was all going to play out and keeping the mood tense. I needed something without a lot of critical thinking in this time of life. And that's what this book was for me. A diverting story that didn't make me think too hard, but managed to still keep me thoroughly engaged and entertained....more","Apr 09, 2020","Apr 16, 2020","Apr 16, 2020",Hardcover,"Mar 03, 2020"

A romance writer and a literary fiction writer both stuck in a rut/experiencing writer's block so they decide to switch genres and try writing again. Oh, and also these two have been rivals/competitive since college. What more do I need to say?! Also, I do enjoy a good book about books.I have heard it said that this is a book prolific romance readers will not love and new or limited romance readers will enjoy and I think that's probably accurate. It doesn't offer a cliched or overly raunchy relationship -- it's more raw and real than that. What I really enjoyed about this is that it really worked to turn those romance stereotypes around. I loved the ""adorkable"" scenes with our leading lady. She's not poised and elegant and sophisticated -- she's just trying her best to make it through and then she discovers her strength in the end. I want to hang out with her and best friend Shaddi. I loved the sense of humor throughout and the hate-to-love trope worked for me. I really think the overall tone of this is to show readers that you don't need to have roses and doves and sunsets to find love (but of course, they do help). :)I will say that the middle of the book did lag just a bit for me (thus knocking off a star), but the last quarter was just perfection for me, really. Loved the ending and the steamy bits were at just the right level to fit my preferences.

I will caution readers looking for a suspense or thriller though. This was a remarkably slow burn beginning. I would say I was about 60% percent done before the action/suspense really started to pick up. The first part of the book is dedicated to setting up the characters and sort of an overall atmosphere or tone for the novel. The MC makes a lot of references to Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights and I can certainly see the connection. Overall, I'd say it's more ""gothic"" than ""suspense."" That being said, the final third of the book definitely takes a turn to horror town. And there are definitely scenes that are pretty graphic and/or disturbing, but it was done in such a way that it wasn't egregiously so.I enjoyed the characters, the setting, the creepy elements.

However, I kept finding myself checking to see how much longer I had to read before I reached the end. Honestly, I think this was maybe just a little over hyped for me. I did enjoy the audio book -- hearing the outlandish story made it more enjoyable. But I had really been sold on the fact that this is a ""really funny book"" and I just didn't find it all that humorous. I mean, yes, there was sarcasm and joking and I did snicker from time to time, but I don't know that it wasn't super engaging for me. Contrast this with something like Bridget Jones' Diary, for example, and it's a let down for me. So, not anything that I would call terrible or worthless. Just a middle of the pack read for me.

I think this is a well written book and I can see its merits, however, I think it's just not to my taste. There was a time in my life where I was very into fantasy and might have dipped into sci fi...but this is not that time. I read this because it was selected as a book club pick and it's not something I would have gravitated towards otherwise. I think the writing was good and the characters were pretty interesting, but just the overall story line and/or subject just didn't strike me as engrossing.Positives:- The character growth. The three main POV were interesting and seemed mostly believable- Action scenes (limited). There were definitely some good action scenes (a pirate battle, yes!) and especially the last two chapters did capture my attention with their fast pace- The personal struggles of the characters. It was compelling what these folks had suffered at the hands of those in power and how that had shaped them- Increasing my diversity in authors and trying out a new authorNegatives:- The writing device that was used for the ""big twist"" or the final resolution.(view spoiler)[I personally just don't care for the device of OH BAM, all these characters are actually the same person! It feels like cheating or like the easy way out somehow.(hide spoiler)]- The ending. I understand this was just the first in the series, but I still feel like the ending fell flat(view spoiler)[ And I sort of despise an ending where the last thing we see is someone dying with so much unfinished business(hide spoiler)]- The technical aspects of the subject matter. Geology interests me very little and the descriptions of the tectonic plates and the types of Earth movements...yawn. I found all the magic that went with this boring, even though it was clear that was supposed to be one of the best bits- Being dropped into an unknown world with very little understanding of the setting. Much of the first quarter of the book involved being confused about what was where, what type of people were responsible for what, the different groups of characters/settings, etc...more","Jul 13, 2020","Jul 20, 2020","Jan 26, 2020",Kindle Edition,"Aug 04, 2015"

To me, this read almost like watching an E True Hollywood feature on a celebrity - except a CLASSY version. It felt like there was really so much heart there, in Evelyn's story and also Monique's. I really enjoyed the drama of how this story developed and the pacing was good. The plot and the characters continued to draw me in throughout and I enjoyed seeing the interaction between Evelyn and Monique. I have heard others express how much they hated the MC, but I didn't feel that way at all. I feel like she was a product of her times and she responded accordingly to combat the ingrained expectations of how her life would turn out. I did not predict the big twist at the end and enjoyed it.

I started out thinking the book was good, but over hyped. And then by the time I'd reached the end of the story, I'd developed a connection to these characters and their struggles and I had a more more emotional reaction than I did at the beginning. I finally settled at a 4.5 because I feel like this is a novel I'm going to remember for a long time.Personally, I feel like this may be the first (or one of very few at least) novel that I've read from the point of view of the people in Nazi-occupied France. So many of the novels that I've read in the past focus on British folks and their struggles, so this was a change of pace for me. This book certainly captured the deprivation, the hopelessness, and the constant anxiety and fear of the future that these people faced every day.I loved how the author based these stories around true acts of resistance during WWII. There really were people that(view spoiler)[hid Jewish children in ""plain sight"" and falsified documents and reports in order to protect them. And there actually was a young girl who took downed Allied airmen through the mountains to safety.(hide spoiler)]It's amazing to me what people will do to protect those in need - heroes all.The writing here was so lovely. Not overly flowery or pretentious, but still very evocative of the setting and especially the emotions of the characters. They felt very real to me as I was reading. I especially identified with the older sister in the story as a mother. The story line moved along pretty quickly after the first say 25% ish of the book.And I really enjoyed the moral ambiguity of the characters throughout. That's reality. It's not always so clear cut about who are ""good guys"" who are ""bad guys"" and that really worked for me in this book.(view spoiler)[ Not every German soldier behaved like a rabid animal and not every French citizen acted heroically to save their countrymen/people. In the case of the first German that was billeted with the family in the countryside, our MC almost had a romantic relationship there - with the enemy - because the world was so harsh and she was so scared and he was kind - as kind as he could be - to her. And yet he betrayed her by making her write the list of Jewish and communist townspeople and in the end, she ended up betraying him by killing him. Who was right? Who was wrong?(hide spoiler)]Love a book that fosters those kind of discussions.I did feel like the romance element of the book was a little stilted and a little awkward in the first part of the book. Although it still didn't feel like the best romantic portrayal (a bit far-fetched), by the end, I was rooting for them to be able to be together. The romance was not a super central aspect of the story, so it was pretty easy to sort of overlook my objections there.In the end, I would certainly recommend this book!...more","Sep 21, 2020","Sep 27, 2020","Jan 23, 2020",Hardcover,"Feb 03, 2015"

Overall, I was happy that I read this one and quite enjoyed the experience.What I loved:- The setting and the atmosphere: beautiful portrayal of both the current and historical scenes in Ireland. Definitely set a mood and a tone and made me want to visit.- The romance: just beautiful writing about love and what it's like to love another so purely and with such consuming passion, but without feeling trite or contrived.- The melding of fictional and historical characters and events: I so enjoyed ""getting to know"" the characters, both fictional and historical. Prompted me to do some further research.- The plot: the details slowly came together to form the final picture and I appreciate how that all culminated, with one or two small objections. I certainly liked more of the plot and only had a few minor questions.What I didn't love (and why I knocked off a star):- A plot hole: I don't want to spoil the ending, so being vague...I couldn't understand why one of the characters didn't try to undo something that had happened. At the end, I saw why she couldn't or at least why it couldn't have been successful, but it seemed unrealistic for her not to at least attempt it.- Je ne sais quoi: while I really enjoyed it, there was just that last little something missing to make me push this into the five star category.

The story starts off as a ""coming of age"" tale as we follow a young girl living alone (or mostly alone) in a North Carolina marsh. But from the beginning, we know there is also a murder mystery occurring. The story moves slowly at first, but I felt the languorous pace really evoked the natural setting of the marsh and the gently flowing estuaries that our main character so adores. However, the last third of the book moved quickly as we go through a murder trial. Overall, I very much enjoyed this book and would recommend. I did knock off .5 of a star because of the ending. I had a different idea of how I thought the book should conclude, but I didn't hate the way the author chose to go.There are definitely themes of feminism, what happens to the ""less than"" in society, and the power of self-preservation woven throughout the story. Many times, after finishing a book, I move right on to the next one (even for really great stories). But this one has me thinking and not yet ready to move on.

On the bus, everyone taunts and bullies her, except for that Asian kid, Park who reads comics on the bus. He offers her a seat on the bus, and the both of them knew they wouldn't talk to each other again. But as school goes on, Park and Eleanor realize that they have more in common than they thought. They begin to fall in love, despite all the obstacles in their way. I enjoyed this book more than I thought I would, mainly because I could relate the most to Park. I face some of the same problems he did throughout the book. I also loved Eleanor, and I could empathize with her when she gets bullied by her classmates.

It ain’t just a story about twThe Fault in Our Stars is one of those books that leaves you feeling lots of emotions—love, pain, hope, and heartbreak. It ain’t just a story about two teens with cancer. It’s about finding a will to live when you’ve accepted death, falling in love when you least expect it, and realizing how life can be beautiful.Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters are both living with the weight of illness, but they are so much more than just patients. Hazel is quiet, almost scared of getting too close to people so she won’t hurt them by dying. Augustus, however, is full of life despite his vulnerability and the challenges he’s learned to live with. When they meet, it’s like their lives aren’t empty anymore.Their bond isn’t cheesy or perfect like in movies. It’s honest, raw, and filled with vulnerability, the kind of love that is both exciting and terrifying. I could almost feel the emotions. Their talks, laughs, and cries were so beautiful yet heart-wrenching.Reading it makes us understand that life isn’t always a fairy tale. This book makes us appreciate the small moments—short conversations, shared glances, and content silence. The way Augustus cried and expressed his emotions while Hazel lay dead, and how he got himself together, would cause one’s heart to shatter.John Green didn’t sugarcoat anything. He tells how painful it can be to love someone who you know will leave someday, but also how worth it love can be. The ending broke me, but also taught me that love isn’t always sunshines and rainbows. In fact, it can be painful and raw. Love is pain, but it can change everything.I personally would rate this book a 5 out of 5 because of how beautifully it’s written. It’s not just a love story—it’s a life story....more","Jun 14, 2023","Jun 15, 2023","Apr 14, 2025",Hardcover,2012

And how stupid Lowen is to just not care about getting pregnant from a guy she's known for a couple weeks?

The writing itself was generally lovely and well done, although there were instances of overly-descriptive passages that became bogged down in unnecessary details. I found the fables intriguing and at points gripping, but felt that the nuanced meaning behind these stories/myths could have been better incorporated into the main story (rather than a weak attempt to suddenly explain everything in the last 5 pages).
